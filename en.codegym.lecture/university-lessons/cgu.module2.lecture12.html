<h2>equals() and hashCode() contracts or whatever</h2>

    <p>The <span class="code text-orange">equals</span> and <span class="code text-orange">hashCode</span> methods are closely related to each other, and it's a good idea to override both methods in a consistent way. Plenty of people know this. But not everyone fully understands the reason for this rule and the consequences for breaking it. </p>

    <p><a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/1989" target="_blank">In this post</a>, we'll take a look at the idea behind these methods, review their purpose, and explore why they're so related.</p>

    <h2>Immutability in Java: final, constants and immutable</h2>
