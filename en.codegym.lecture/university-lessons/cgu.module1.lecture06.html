<p>To consolidate your knowledge, you need to solve tasks, of course. And a bit of "reading at home" won't hurt either. Here are some lessons to help you delve deeper into the topics we covered.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/5-scanner-class" target="_blank">Scanner class</a></h2>
<p>As you already know, this class makes life a little easier for Java developers who get tripped up by readers. It can do a lot, and you've already managed to use it a few times. If you haven't already done so, read the article entitled "The Scanner class", study the examples, and try to use the class yourself.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/java-operators" target="_blank">Operations on numbers in Java</a></h2>
<p>Programming involves lots of operations on numbers, so we'll consider the most important of them, including with examples. How do I operate on numbers in Java? There are various ways: There are ordinary arithmetic operations, and there are somewhat less familiar logical operations. And there are also bitwise operations, which are completely exotic for non-IT people. It's time to dive into this material as well as operator precedence in our favorite language.</p>
