Stop the Raging Stream: Official Version
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
There will be a lot of aggressive words in this lecture, the meaning of which is translated as "interfere" or "interrupt." And all because we continue to study the possibilities and features of stopping the threads. Or streams, as everyone calls them. Learn how to use the isInterrupted variable and what the isInterrupted() and interrupt() methods do.

<p>"Hello, Amigo! You have to admit that Ellie's Cancel idea was brilliant."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yep."</span></p>
<p>"Actually, something similar exists in the <strong>Thread</strong> class. Only the variable isn't called <strong>isCancel</strong>. It's called <strong>isInterrupt</strong>. And the method used to stop the thread isn't <strong>cancel()</strong>. It's <strong>interrupt()</strong>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Really?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. Check it out:"</p>

<p>Moreover, the <strong>sleep</strong> method, which people are so fond of using in endless loops in the <strong>run</strong> method, automatically checks the <strong>isInterrupt</strong> variable. If a thread calls the <strong>sleep</strong> method, the method first checks whether <strong>isInterrupt</strong> is true for that thread. If it is true, the method won't sleep. Instead, it throws an <span class="text-red"><strong>InterruptedException</strong></span> exception.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Why throw an exception? Wouldn't it be better to simply put isInterrupted() instead of isCancel() in a loop?"</span></p>
<p>"<strong>First</strong>, the <strong>run</strong> method doesn't always have a loop. The method might simply consist of a few dozen calls to other methods. Then you would have to add an isInterrupted check before each method call."</p>
<p>"<strong>Second</strong>, some method that involves lots of different actions might take a very long time to execute."</p>
<p>"<strong>Third</strong>, throwing an exception doesn't replace the isInterrupted check. It's just a convenient addition. The thrown exception lets you to quickly unwind the call stack back to the <strong>run</strong> method itself."</p>
<p>"<strong>Fourth</strong>, the sleep method is used a lot. As it turns out, this helpful method is enhanced by an implicit check that is no less helpful. <strong>It's as if nobody specifically added the check, but there it is.</strong> This is super valuable when you're using someone else's code and you can't add the check yourself."</p>
<p>"<strong>Fifth</strong>, the additional check doesn't degrade performance. Calling the sleep method means that the thread shouldn't be doing anything (except sleeping), so the extra work doesn't bother anyone."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Those are serious arguments."</span></p>
<p>"And, <strong>finally</strong>, there's this: Your run method can call someone else's code—code that you don't have access to (source code and/or rights to change the code). It might not have isInterrupted checks, and it might use "<strong>try ... catch (Exception e)</strong>" to catch all exceptions."</p>
<p><span class="text-red"><strong>Nobody can guarantee that a thread will be stopped. Only a thread can stop itself.</strong></span></p>
