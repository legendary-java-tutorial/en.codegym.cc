Debug in IDEA
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Bug Programmers have their own slang, although many consider it to be technical jargon. In any case, you can not avoid either getting to know him or studying in detail. So start getting involved. One of the first words that you will meet will be the word bug (bug, beetle in English). It's words

<h2>1. Bug</h2>
<p>Programmers have their own slang, though many consider it to be technical jargon. In any case, you cannot avoid getting to know it. You need to dive into the detail. So let's dive in.</p>
<p>One of the first words you will get to know is "<span class="term text-red">bug</span>",&nbsp;i.e. an <span class="term">insect</span>. In the context of software development, this word means an <span class="text-red">error</span> in a program, an instance of the program doing something wrong or not quite right. Or simply working strangely.</p>
<p>But if a programmer thinks the program, despite its odd behavior, is doing exactly what it is supposed to, then he or she usually declares something like "it's not a bug, it's a feature". Which has spawned a bunch of internet memes.</p>

<p>In general, there can be any number of reasons for a software defect: anything from errors in the program's logic, typos, and incorrect program architecture, right up to problems in the compiler. In any case, programmers need to fix both real bugs and any other "shortcomings" in their programs.</p>
<p><strong>The history of the word "bug"</strong></p>
<p>The most common version of the origin of the word "bug" is something of a legend.</p>
<p>In September 1945, scientists at Harvard University were testing one of the first computers, the Mark II. The computer wasn't working properly, and in the process of checking all the boards, they found a moth stuck between the contacts of an electromechanical relay.</p>
<p>The extracted insect was taped into a technical log, accompanied by this inscription: "First actual case of bug being found."</p>
<p>This funny story is believed to be the beginning of the use of the word "<span class="term">bug</span>" to mean an error, and the word "<span class="term">debug</span>" has become synonymous with eliminating bugs.</p>

<h2>2. Debugging the program</h2>
<p>To fix bugs in their programs, programmers use special programs called <span class="term">debuggers</span>. Some of these programs even know how to debug machine code.</p>
<p>Java programmers use IDEs for <span class="term">debugging</span> their programs. Such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans. IntelliJ IDEA is by far the most powerful IDE, so we'll walk through the debugging process using it as an example.</p>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA can run your program in two modes:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Execution modes</th>
        <th>Toolbar icon</th>
        <th>Hotkeys</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Normal execution</td>
        <td>
            <img src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/a5a480bd-8c0b-4972-9171-82dd663fb013/original.png" alt="">
        </td>
        <td><code>Shift</code>+<code>F10</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Start in debug mode</td>
        <td>
            <img src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/ad4fdaa5-392c-46a7-868e-52f35385f9d2/original.png" alt="">
        </td>
        <td><code>Shift</code>+<code>F9</code></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>You are already familiar with normal execution: the program starts, runs, and exits. But debug mode has a lot of surprises in store for you.</p>
<p><strong>Debug mode</strong></p>
<p>Debug mode lets you to walk <span class="term text-brown">step by step</span> through your entire program. Or more accurately, it lets you move <span class="term text-green">line by line</span>. What's more, you can observe the values of the variables at each step of the program (after each line of code is executed). And you can even change their values!</p>
<p>To gain even a minimal grasp of debugging a program, you need to learn three things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Breakpoints</li>
    <li>Step-by-step execution</li>
    <li>Inspecting the value of variables</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>3. <span class="term">Breakpoints</span></h2>
<p>The IDE lets you place special markers called <span class="term">breakpoints</span> in your code. Every time a program running in debug mode reaches a line marked with a <span class="term">breakpoint</span>, execution will pause.</p>
<p>To put a <span class="term">breakpoint</span> on a specific line, you just need to click to the left of the line in IDEA. Example:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="e1a26461-ea43-4b6e-9e22-4dd6c986eec3" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/e1a26461-ea43-4b6e-9e22-4dd6c986eec3/1080.jpeg" alt="Breakpoints IntelliJ IDEA">
<p>The line will be marked with a breakpoint, and IntelliJ IDEA will <span class="text-red">highlight</span> it in red:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="75342ff0-9ede-4b9c-a1fa-c21e9dfbd19b" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/75342ff0-9ede-4b9c-a1fa-c21e9dfbd19b/1080.jpeg" alt="marked with a breakpoint">
<p>A second mouse click on the pane to the left of the code will remove the <span class="term">breakpoint</span>.</p>
<p>A <span class="term text-red">breakpoint</span> can also be placed on the current line simply by using the hotkey combination <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>F8</code>. Pressing <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>F8</code> again on a line that already has a <span class="term text-red">breakpoint</span> will delete it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Start the program in debug mode</h2>
<p>If you have at least one breakpoint in your program, you can run the program in debug mode by pressing <code>Shift</code>+<code>F9</code> or clicking the "bug icon".</p>
<p>After starting in debug mode, the program runs as usual. But as soon as it reaches a line of code marked with a <span class="term">breakpoint</span>, it will pause. Example:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="f785b37a-f1dc-4e38-ab57-94f02a03e1a8" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/f785b37a-f1dc-4e38-ab57-94f02a03e1a8/1080.jpeg" alt="Start the program in debug mode">
<p>In the upper half of the screenshot, you see program code with two breakpoints. The program's execution stopped on line 5, which is marked with a blue line. Line 5 has not been executed yet: nothing has been output to the console yet.</p>
<p>In the lower half of the screen, you see the debug panes: the <span class="term text-user">Debugger</span> pane, the <span class="term text-green">Console</span>&nbsp;pane, and a set of buttons for debug mode.</p>
<p>You can unpause your program (i.e. continue execution) by pressing the <span class="term">Resume Program</span> button on the bottom left pane (or press <code>F9</code>).</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="1bbf1b14-3954-4d07-982f-972154aa1f1d" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/1bbf1b14-3954-4d07-982f-972154aa1f1d/1080.jpeg" alt="Start the program in debug mode 3">
<p>If you press this button (or <code>F9</code>), the program will continue to run until it encounters the next <span class="term text-red">breakpoint</span> or ends. Here's what we see after clicking the button:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="9ca742de-2da0-4037-9e03-2bb4f7ab2229" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/9ca742de-2da0-4037-9e03-2bb4f7ab2229/1080.jpeg" alt="Start the program in debug mode 4">
<p>The program stopped at the second breakpoint, and the words <code>Hello</code> and <code>and</code> can be seen in the console. This is a sign that we have executed only two of the three lines that display output on the screen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Step-by-step execution</h2>
<p>If your program is running in debug mode, you can also step through it: <span class="term text-green">one&nbsp;step</span> is<span class="term text-green">one&nbsp;line</span>. There are two hotkeys for step-by-step execution: <code>F7</code> and <code>F8</code>: each causes the current line of code to be executed. But first, you still have to stop your program with a <span class="term text-red">breakpoint</span>.</p>
<p>If you want to execute your program line by line, you need to put <span class="term">breakpoint</span> at the beginning of the <code>main()</code> method and run it in debug mode.</p>
<p>When the program stops, you can start executing it line by line. One press of the <code>F8</code> key executes one line.</p>
<p>This is what our program looks like after it stops and we press the <code>F8</code> key once:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="3eb98dd0-f2b0-4429-9d98-2ddd32e09091" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/3eb98dd0-f2b0-4429-9d98-2ddd32e09091/1080.jpeg" alt="Start the program in debug mode. Step-by-step execution">
<p>The first line of the main method has already been executed, and the current line is the second line. You can also see at the bottom of the screenshot that the word <code>Hello</code> is already displayed on the screen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Step-by-step execution with stepping into methods</h2>
<p>If you have written your own methods in the program and you want execution to go inside your methods in debug mode, i.e. you want to "step into the method", then you need to press <code>F7</code> rather than <code>F8</code>.</p>
<p>Let's say you step through the program and are now stopped at line 4. If you press <code>F8</code>, IDEA will simply execute the fourth line and move on to the fifth.</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="ec19b61f-d25c-4e2c-b869-54e6c6e742a1" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/ec19b61f-d25c-4e2c-b869-54e6c6e742a1/1080.jpeg" alt="Step-by-step execution with stepping into methods 2">
<p>But if you press <code>F7</code>, IDEA will step into the <code>main2()</code> method:</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="f90397c8-a284-45ff-99a9-95d1e63f0a8f" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/f90397c8-a284-45ff-99a9-95d1e63f0a8f/1080.jpeg" alt="Step-by-step execution with stepping into methods 3">
<p>It's very simple. If you don't really care what happens inside a method or how, then you press <code>F8</code>. If it is important, then press <code>F7</code> and step through all its code.</p>
