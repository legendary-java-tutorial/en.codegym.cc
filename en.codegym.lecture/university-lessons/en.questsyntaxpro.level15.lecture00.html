try with resources statement
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
External Resources Sometimes, in the course of running a Java program, it interacts with objects outside the Java machine, such as files on disk. Such objects are called external resources. Internal resources are objects created inside the Java machine. Usually the interaction goes like this
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<h2>1. External resources</h2>
<p>As a Java program runs, sometimes it interacts with entities outside the Java machine. For example, with files on disk. These entities are usually called external resources. Internal resources are the objects created inside the Java machine.</p>
<p>Typically, the interaction follows this scheme:</p>
<p><img width="1024" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/3f96be77-d3c0-469d-a183-2f7570a27bff/1024.jpeg" alt="Try-with-resources statement"></p>
<p><strong>Tracking resources</strong></p>
<p>The operating system rigorously keeps track of the resources available, and also controls shared access to them from different programs. For example, if one program changes a file, then another program cannot change (or delete) that file. This principle isn't limited to files, but they provide the most readily understandable example.</p>
<p>The operating system has functions (APIs) that allow a program to acquire and/or release resources. If a resource is busy, then only the program that acquired it can work with it. If a resource is free, then any program can acquire it.</p>
<p>Imagine that your office has shared coffee mugs. If someone takes a mug, then other people can no longer take it. But once the mug is used, washed, and put back in its place, then anyone can take it again. The situation with seats on a bus or subway is the same. If a seat is free, then anyone can take it. If a seat is occupied, then it is controlled by the person who took it.</p>
<p><strong>Acquiring external resources</strong>.</p>
<p>Every time your Java program starts working with a file on disk, the Java machine asks the operating system for exclusive access to it. If the resource is free, then the Java machine acquires it.</p>
<p>But after you've finished working with the file, this resource (file) must be released, i.e. you need to notify the operating system that you no longer need it. <span class="text-viola">If you do not do this, then the resource will continue to be held by your program.</span></p>
<p>The operating system maintains a list of resources occupied by each running program. If your program exceeds the assigned resource limit, then the operating system will no longer give you new resources.</p>
<p>The good news is that if your program terminates, all resources are automatically released (the operating system itself does this).</p>
<p>The bad news is that if you're writing a server application (and a lot of server applications are written in Java), your server needs to be able to run for days, weeks, and months without stopping. And if you open 100 files a day and don't close them, then in a couple of weeks your application will reach its resource limit and crash. That's falling far short of months of stable work.</p>

<h2>2. <code>close()</code> method</h2>
<p>Classes that use external resources have a special method for releasing them: <code>close()</code>.</p>
<p>Below we provide an example of a program that writes something to a file and then closes the file when it is done, i.e. it frees up the operating system's resources. It looks something like this:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Code</th>
        <th>Note</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code>String <span class="text-green">path</span> = "c:\\projects\\log.txt";
<span>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
</span><span><span class="text-user">output</span></span>.write(1);
<span><span class="text-user">output</span></span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>The path to the file.<br>
            Get the file object: acquire the resource.<br>
            Write to the file<br>
            Close the file - release the resource
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>After working with a file (or other external resources), you have to call the <code>close()</code> method on the object linked to the external resource.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>It all seems simple. But exceptions can occur as a program runs, and the external resource won't be released. And that is very bad.</p>
<p>To ensure that the <code>close()</code> method is always called, we need to wrap our code in a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>-<code>finally</code> block and add the <code>close()</code> method to the <code>finally</code> block. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>try
{
   FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(path);
   output.write(1);
   output.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p>This code will not compile, because the <code>output</code> variable is declared inside the <code>try {}</code> block, and therefore is not visible in the <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>Let's fix it:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(path);

try
{
   output.write(1);
   output.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p>It's okay, but it won't work if an error occurs when we create the <code>FileOutputStream</code> object, and this could happen quite easily.</p>
<p>Let's fix it:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p>There are still a few criticisms. First, if an error occurs when creating the <code>FileOutputStream</code> object, then the <code>output</code> variable will be null. This possibility must be accounted for in the <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>Second, the <code>close()</code> method is always called in the <code>finally</code> block, which means that it is not necessary in the <code>try</code> block. The final code will look like this:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   if (<span class="text-user">output</span> != null)
      <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p>Even if we don't consider the <code>catch</code> block, which can be omitted, then our 3 lines of code become 10. But we basically just opened the file and wrote 1. A little cumbersome, don't you think?</p>

<h2>3. <code>try</code>-with-resources</h2>
<p>And here Java's creators decided to sprinkle some syntactic sugar on us. Starting with its 7th version, Java has a new <code>try</code>-with-resources statement.</p>
<p>It was created precisely to solve the problem with the mandatory call to the <code>close()</code> method. The general case looks quite simple:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
<pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-red">try</span> (<span class="text-viola">ClassName</span> <span class="code text-user">name</span> = new <span class="text-viola">ClassName</span>())
{
     <span class="text-user">Code that works with the</span> <span class="text-user code">name</span> variable
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This is another variation of the <code>try</code> <span class="term">statement</span>. You need to add parentheses after the <code>try</code> keyword, and then create objects with external resources inside the parentheses. For each object in the parentheses, the compiler adds a <code>finally</code> section and a call to the <code>close()</code> method.</p>
<p>Below are two equivalent examples:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Long code</th>
        <th>Code with try-with-resources</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code><span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span> <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output </span>= new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}
finally
{
   if (output != null)
  <span class="text-user"> output</span>.close();
}</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code>try(<span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span> output = new <span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span>(path))
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The code using <code>try</code>-with-resources is much shorter and easier to read. And the less code we have, the less chance of making a typo or other error.</p>
<p>By the way, we can add <code>catch</code> and <code>finally</code> blocks to the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement. Or you can not add them if they aren't needed.</p>

<h2>4. Several variables at the same time</h2>
<p>By the way, you may often encounter a situation when you need to open several files at the same time. Let's say you are copying a file, so you need two objects: the file from which you are copying data and the file to which you are copying data.</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement lets you create one but several objects in it. The code that creates the objects must be separated by semicolons. Here's the general appearance of this statement:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
<pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-red">try</span> (<span class="text-viola">ClassName</span> <span class="code text-user">name</span> = new <span class="text-viola">ClassName</span>(); <span class="text-orange">ClassName2</span> <span class="code text-user">name2</span> = new <span class="text-orange">ClassName2</span>())
{
   <span class="text-user">Code that works with the <span class="code text-user">name</span> and <span class="code text-user">name2</span> variables</span>
}</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Well, what can we say here? <code>try</code>-with-resources is a wonderful thing!</p>

<h2>5. <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface</h2>
<p>But that's not all. The attentive reader will immediately begin to look for pitfalls that limits how this statement can be applied.</p>
<p>But how does the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement work if the class does not have a <code>close()</code> method? Well, suppose that nothing will be called. No method, no problem.</p>
<p>But how does the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement work if the class has several <code>close()</code> methods? And they need arguments to be passed to them? And the class doesn't have a <code>close()</code> method without parameters?</p>
<p>I hope you really asked yourself these questions, and perhaps still others.</p>
<p>To avoid such issues, Java's creators came up with a special interface called <code>AutoCloseable</code>, which has only one method — <code>close()</code>, which has no parameters.</p>
<p>They also added the restriction that <span class="text-orange">only objects of classes that implement <code>AutoCloseable</code></span> can be declared as resources in a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement. As a result, such objects will always have a <code>close()</code> method with no parameters.</p>
<p>By the way, do you think it's possible for a <code>try</code>-with-resources statement to declare as a resource an object whose class has its own <code>close()</code> method without parameters but which does not implement <code>AutoCloseable</code>?</p>
<p><span class="text-red">The bad news:</span> The correct answer is no — the classes must implement the <code>AutoCloseable</code> interface.</p>
<p><span class="text-green">The good news:</span> Java has a lot of classes that implement this interface, so it's very likely that everything will work as it should.</p>
