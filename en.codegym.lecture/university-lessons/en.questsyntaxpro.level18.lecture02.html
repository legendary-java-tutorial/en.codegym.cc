<h2>1. Innovations in Java 8: Functional programming</h2>
<p>With the release of Java 8, the language gained powerful support for <span class="term text-viola">functional programming</span>. You could even say it gained long-awaited support for functional programming. Coding became faster, although the code was more difficult to read ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Before learning <span class="term text-viola">functional programming</span> in Java, we recommend that you understand three things well:</p>
<ol>
    <li>OOP, inheritance and interfaces (<a href="https://codegym.cc/quests/QUEST_JAVA_CORE">Levels 1-2 in the Java Core quest</a>).</li>
    <li><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/102-default-methods-in-interfaces">Default method implementations in an interface</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/262-nested-inner-classes">Inner</a> and <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/261-anonymous-classes">anonymous classes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="text-green">good news</span> is that you don't have to know all this to use many of the features of functional programming in Java. The <span class="text-red">bad news</span> is that it will be difficult to understand exactly how everything is arranged and how everything works without knowing about anonymous inner classes.</p>
<p>In the upcoming lessons, we will focus on how easy and simple it is to use Java's functional programming features, without a deep understanding of how it works.</p>
<p>It takes months to understand all the nuances of functional programming in Java. You can learn to read such code in a few hours. So we suggest starting small. Even if it's with I/O streams.</p>

<h2>2. I/O streams: stream pipelines</h2>
<p>Do you remember that once upon a time you learned about I/O streams: <code>InputStream</code>, <code>OutputStream</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>Writer</code> etc.?</p>
<p>There were stream classes that read data from <span class="code text-yellow">data sources</span>, such as <code class="text-green">FileInputSteam</code>, and there were intermediate data streams that read data from other streams, such as <code class="text-user">InputStreamReader</code> and <code class="text-viola">BufferedReader</code>.</p>
<p>These streams could be organized into data processing pipelines. For example, like this:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>FileInputStream <span class="code text-green">input</span> = new FileInputStream("<span class="code text-yellow">c:\\readme.txt</span>");
InputStreamReader <span class="code text-user">reader</span> = new InputStreamReader(<span class="code text-green">input</span>);
BufferedReader <span class="code text-viola">buff</span> = new BufferedReader(<span class="code text-user">reader</span>);

String text = <span class="code text-viola">buff</span>.readLine();</code></pre>
<p>It's important to note that in the first few lines of code, we're just constructing a chain of <code>Stream</code> objects. The data hasn't passed through the pipeline yet.</p>
<p>But as soon as we call the <code>buff.readLine()</code> method, the following will happen:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The <code class="text-viola">BufferedReader</code> object calls the <code>read()</code> method on the <code>InputStreamReader</code> object</li>
    <li>The <code class="text-user">InputStreamReader</code> object calls the <code>read()</code> method on the <code>FileInputStream</code> object</li>
    <li>The <code class="text-green">FileInputStream</code> object starts reading data <span class="code text-yellow">from the file</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, there is no movement of data along the stream pipeline until we start calling methods like <code>read()</code> or <code>readLine()</code>. The mere construction of the stream pipeline does not drive data through it. The streams themselves do not store data. They only read from others.</p>
<p>Collections and streams</p>
<p>Starting with Java 8, it became possible to get a stream to read data from collections (and not only from them). But this is not the most interesting thing. It actually became possible to easily and simply construct complex chains of data streams. And in doing so, the code that previously took 5-10 lines could now be written in 1-2 lines.</p>
<p>Example of finding the longest string in a list of strings:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Finding the longest string</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code><span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="text-green">list</span> = new <span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt;();
<span class="text-neon">Collections</span>.addAll(<span class="text-green">list</span>, "Hello", "how's", "life?");
<span class="text-neon">String</span> max = <span class="text-green">list</span>.stream().max(<span class="text-viola">(s1, s2)-&gt; s1.length()-s2.length()</span>).<span class="text-red">get</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code><span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="text-green">list</span> = new <span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt;();
<span class="text-neon">Collections</span>.addAll(<span class="text-green">list</span>, "Hello", "how's", "life?");
<span class="text-neon">Stream</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="text-green">stream</span> = <span class="text-green">list</span>.stream();
<span class="text-neon">Optional</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="text-green">optional</span> = <span class="text-green">stream</span>.max(<span class="text-viola">(s1, s2)-&gt; s1.length()-s2.length()</span>);
<span class="text-neon">String</span> max = <span class="text-green">optional</span>.<span class="text-red">get</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>3. <code>Stream</code> interface</h2>
<p>Java 8's extended support for streams is implemented using the <code class="code-raw"><span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;T&gt;</code> interface, where <code>T</code> is a type parameter that indicates the type of data being passed in the stream. In other words, a stream is completely independent of the type of data it passes.</p>
<p>To get a stream object from a <span class="term text-green">collection</span>, just call its <code class="text-red">stream()</code> method. The code looks roughly like this:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present language-java text-center"><code><span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;Type&gt; <span class="code text-user">name</span> = <span class="code text-green">collection</span>.<span class="code text-red">stream()</span>;</code></pre>
    <div class="lesson-example-caption">Getting a stream from a collection</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, the collection will be considered the stream's data source, and the <code class="code-raw"><span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;Type&gt;</code> object will be a tool for obtaining data from the collection in the form of a data stream.</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code><span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="code text-green">list</span> = new <span class="text-neon">ArrayList</span>&lt;String&gt;();
<span class="text-neon">Collections</span>.addAll(<span class="code text-green">list</span>, "Hello", "how's", "life?");
<span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;String&gt; <span class="code text-user">stream</span> = <span class="code text-green">list</span>.<span class="code text-red">stream()</span>;</code></pre>
<p>By the way, you can get a stream not only from collections, but also from <span class="term text-brown">arrays</span>. To do this, you need to use the <code class="code-raw"><span class="code text-neon">Arrays</span>.<span class="code text-red">stream</span>()</code> method. For example:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present language-java"><code><span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;Type&gt; <span class="code text-user">name</span> = <span class="code text-neon">Arrays</span>.<span class="code text-red">stream</span>(<span class="code text-brown">array</span>);</code></pre>
    <div class="lesson-example-caption">Getting a stream from an array</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, the <span class="term text-brown">array</span> will be considered the data source for the <span class="term text-red">stream</span> called <code class="text-user">name</code>.</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>Integer[] <span class="code text-brown">array</span> = {1, 2, 3};
<span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;Integer&gt; <span class="code text-user">stream</span> = <span class="code text-neon">Arrays</span>.<span class="code text-red">stream</span>(<span class="code text-brown">array</span>);</code></pre>
<p>No data is moved when the <code class="code-raw"><span class="code text-viola">Stream</span>&lt;Type&gt;</code> object is created. We simply got a stream object in order to start building a stream pipeline.</p>
