Useful links from the Professor — 14
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Of course, looking at the same material from different angles is useful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps for you the best source of the theory will be different from the source best suited to your friend. Especially for you, the Professor found a very interesting lesson on type casting and instanceof.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hello, Amigo! Nice to see you again. Well, have you coped with the instanceof operator and type casting? As always, I'm delighted at your success."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, it wasn't so difficult. I can't wait to find out what's next!"</span></p> 
<p>"What's next is even more interesting. I think it'll be interesting for you to study a couple of relevant lessons, especially since I once wrote them from memory…"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"When? Sorry, Professor. I didn't hear."</span></p>
<p>"Uh, right now. Sit down and get comfortable. Enjoy your reading!"</p>
<p><big><strong>How the instanceof operator works</strong></big></p> 
<p>This isn't our first introduction to instanceof, but now you know much more about inheritance and other principles of OOP. It's time to <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/105-how-the-instanceof-operator-works' target='_blank'>understand how conversion operators work</a>. Consider some practical examples and analyze potential errors.</p>
<p><big><strong>Widening and narrowing of reference types</strong></big></p> 
<p>In a previous lesson, we explored converting primitive types. But <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/106-widening-and-narrowing-of-reference-types' target='_blank'>now let's talk</a> about the same operators applied not to primitive types, but to objects and reference variables.</p>
