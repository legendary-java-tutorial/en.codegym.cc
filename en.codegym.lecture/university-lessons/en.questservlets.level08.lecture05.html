<h2>6.1 Introduction to VPN</h2>
<p><strong>Virtual Private Network</strong> or <strong>VPN</strong> is literally a virtual private network. Most likely,
    you often heard the word VPN when you wanted to change the country in the browser of your phone or computer. Launch
    VPN, select a country and you're done.</p>

<p>Although VPNs, in fact, have nothing to do with countries. The case is a little different.</p>
<p>Imagine that you work in an office on a computer, and in this office there are various computer equipment with
    network access: computers, servers, printers, video conferencing equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Situation 1</strong> : your office has grown, you decided to move to the next floor. You took your computer,
    moved it to another room, plugged it into another network outlet, and you still have access to all the servers and
    computers of the company.</p>
<p>Most likely, your computer is now talking to another router, but all the routers in your company know how to
    communicate with each other and provide you with all the benefits of being on the same local network. You have no
    problem accessing any equipment on the corporate network.</p>
<p><strong>Situation 2</strong> : A pandemic has begun and you decide to work from home. You took your work computer
    home, but bad luck, there is no access to office servers at home. It seems to be logical, because they stayed at the
    office at the other end of the city. On the other hand, the question arises: when you transferred the computer in
    the first case, you still had access to office computers. When you moved the computer in the second case, there is
    no access. What has changed?</p>
<p>In the first case, all computers in your office (even those located on different floors) were on the same local
    network. But in the second case, no. Your computer at home is not connected to the office LAN. Accordingly, you do
    not have access to the internal resources of the office network.</p>
<p>As a solution to this problem, a solution was proposed - <strong>a virtual local area network</strong> (VPN). In your
    office, on each floor, there was a router that sent data to each other and ensured the operation of the local
    network.</p>
<p>We need to create two <strong>virtual routers</strong> (in the form of programs), one in your office, the second at
    home, which will also send encrypted data to each other over the Internet. And there are such programs: one of them
    is called <strong>VPN server</strong> , and the second is <strong>VPN client</strong> .</p>
<p>The VPN server is configured by the system administrator in the office, and the VPN client is now in every computer
    and/or phone.</p>
<p>You launch a VPN client on your computer and use it to connect to the VPN server, so the computer now thinks that it
    is inside the local network where the VPN server is located.</p>
<p>If you now launch your browser, then all data from your browser will go to your local virtual router (VPN client),
    from it to the company’s virtual router (VPN server), and then further out into the world through the Internet
    gateway of your office companies.</p>
<p>The external IP address of your computer will now match the public IP address of your office. And if this office was,
    for example, in Germany, then the server that your browser accessed will be sure that you are in an office in
    Germany.</p>
<h2>6.2 VPN types</h2>
<p>VPN networks are divided according to their target functions. There are many different ones, but here is a list of
    typical VPN solutions:</p>
<h3>Intranet VPN</h3>
<p>It is used to combine several distributed branches of one organization into a single secure network, exchanging data
    via open communication channels. This is the first one that started it all.</p>
<h3>Remote Access VPN</h3>
<p>It is used to create a secure channel between a corporate network segment (central office or branch office) and a
    single user who, while working at home, connects to corporate resources from a home computer, corporate laptop,
    smartphone, or Internet kiosk. This is the option you have if you work from home and connect to the office via a
    VPN.</p>
<h3>Extranet VPN</h3>
<p>Used for networks to which "external" users (for example, customers or clients) connect. The level of trust in them
    is much lower than in the company's employees, so it is necessary to provide special "frontiers" of protection that
    prevent or restrict the latter's access to especially valuable, confidential information.</p>
<h3>Internet VPN</h3>
<p>Used by providers to provide access to the Internet, usually if several users connect via one physical channel. The
    PPPoE protocol has become the standard in ADSL connections.</p>
<p>L2TP was widespread in the mid-2000s in home networks: in those days, intranet traffic was not paid, and external
    traffic was expensive. This made it possible to control costs: when the VPN connection is turned off, the user does
    not pay anything.</p>
<p>Currently, wired Internet is cheap or unlimited, and on the user's side there is often a router on which turning the
    Internet on and off is not as convenient as on a computer. Therefore, L2TP access is a thing of the past.</p>
<h3>Client/server VPN</h3>
<p>Also a popular option. It ensures the protection of transmitted data between two nodes (not networks) of a corporate
    network. The peculiarity of this option is that the VPN is built between nodes that are usually located in the same
    network segment, for example, between a workstation and a server. This need very often arises in cases where it is
    necessary to create several logical networks in one physical network.</p>
<p>For example, when it is necessary to divide the traffic between the financial department and the human resources
    department, accessing servers located in the same physical segment. This option is similar to VLAN technology, but
    instead of separating traffic, it is encrypted.</p>
<h2>6.3 OpenVPN</h2>
<p>Remember, we talked about a virtual router on the office side, to which you can connect using VPN clients? So, there
    is one very popular solution that it will be useful for you to know about. This is OpenVPN.</p>
<p><strong>OpenVPN</strong> is a free program that implements virtual private network (VPN) technology. It supports two
    popular modes of operation: client-server and point-to-point, when you need to combine two large networks.</p>
<p>It maintains a good level of traffic encryption between its participants, and also allows you to establish
    connections between computers behind NAT and a firewall without having to change their settings.</p>
<p>To secure the control channel and data flow, OpenVPN uses the <strong>OpenSSL</strong> library . This allows you to
    use the entire set of encryption algorithms available in this library.</p>
<p><strong>It can also use HMAC</strong> batch authentication for more security and hardware acceleration to improve
    encryption performance. This library uses OpenSSL, more specifically, <strong>the SSLv3/TLSv1.2</strong> protocols .
</p>
<p>There are implementations of this program for all popular operating systems: Solaris, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
    GNU/Linux, Apple Mac OS X, QNX, Microsoft Windows, Android, iOS.</p>
<p>OpenVPN offers the user <strong>several types of authentication</strong> :</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The preset key</strong> is the easiest method.</li>
    <li><strong>Certificate authentication</strong> is the most flexible method in settings.</li>
    <li>Using <strong>a login</strong> and <strong>password</strong> - can be used without creating a client certificate
        (a server certificate is still needed).
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical information</h3>
<p>OpenVPN conducts all network operations over TCP or UDP transport. In general, UDP is preferred because the tunnel
    will carry network layer traffic and above over OSI if a TUN connection is used, or link layer traffic and above if
    TAP is used.</p>
<p>This means that OpenVPN acts as a channel or even physical layer protocol for the client, which means that data
    transfer reliability can be ensured by higher OSI levels, if necessary.</p>
<p>Given that we have well analyzed the OSI model, you should understand what is being said here.</p>
<p>That is why the UDP protocol, in its concept, is closest to OpenVPN, since it, like the protocols of the data link
    and physical layers, does not provide connection reliability, passing this initiative to higher levels. If you
    configure the tunnel to work over TCP, the server will typically receive OpenVPN TCP segments that contain other TCP
    segments from the client.</p>
<p>Also, which is not unimportant, OpenVPN can work through most of the proxy servers, including HTTP, SOCKS, through
    NAT and network filters. The server can be configured to assign network settings to the client. For example, IP
    address, routing settings, and connection parameters. </p>
