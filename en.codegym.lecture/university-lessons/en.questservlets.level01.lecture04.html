Phases of a Maven project
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
List of project phases Project assembly Work cycles
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<h2>5.1 List of phases</h2>
<p>Finally we get to this part, the assembly of the project. And then you will be a little surprised. Well, or strongly, as it turns out. Maven has revised its approach to building a project. And now you will be convinced of it.</p>
<p>The entire assembly of the project was divided into phases, the description of which I will give in the table below:</p>
<div class="table-container">
 <table>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <th width="5%">order</th>
    <th>Phase</th>
    <th></th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td><strong>validate</strong></td>
    <td>checks the correctness of meta-information about the project</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td><strong>compile</strong></td>
    <td>compiles sources</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td><strong>test</strong></td>
    <td>runs the class tests from the previous step</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td><strong>package</strong></td>
    <td>packs the compiled classes into a new artifact: jar, war, zip, ...</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td><strong>verify</strong></td>
    <td>checks the correctness of the artifact and the satisfaction of quality requirements</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>6</td>
    <td><strong>install</strong></td>
    <td>puts the artifact in the local repository</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>7</td>
    <td><strong>deploy</strong></td>
    <td>uploads an artifact to a production server or remote repository</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
</div>
<p>At the same time, <span class="text-red">the steps are clearly sequential</span> . If you tell Maven to run the package command, it will first run the validate, compile, test phases and only then package</p>
<p>In principle, there is nothing new here, except that there are separate phases for quality control: validate, test, verify. And as many as two phases for deploying the assembly - install and deploy.</p>
<p>To start a specific phase, it is enough to write the <strong>maven phase</strong> command . For example, to build, you need to run the <strong>maven package</strong> command . Etc.</p>
<p>Intellij IDEA is great at working with these phases and it has a special menu <strong>on the right</strong> for these purposes:</p><img data-max-width="512" data-id="371a42b2-6c0f-4399-b875-2986c86af0a0" alt="maven phase" src="https://cdn.javarush.com/images/article/371a42b2-6c0f-4399-b875-2986c86af0a0/512.jpeg" style="width: 512px;">
<p>Here, in addition to the well-known phases, IDEA displays 2 more commands: <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>site</strong> . clean is used to completely clear the target folder, and site can create project documentation.</p>
<h2>5.2 Building a project</h2>
<p>If you want to compile the project, then you need to run the compile phase. This can be done using the command line: <strong>mvn compile</strong> or through the IDEA interface by clicking on the <strong>compile</strong> item .</p>
<p>After that, Maven will start building the project and you will see a log of the build process similar to this:</p>
<pre class=""><code>[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 0.742 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2016-09-19T22:41:26+04:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 7M/18M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>
<p>If something went wrong, the log will look like this:</p>
<pre class=""><code>[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.8.0:compile (default-compile) on project demo: Fatal error compiling: invalid target release: 11 -&gt; [Help 1]
[ERROR]
[ERROR] To see the full stack trace of the errors, re-run Maven with the -e switch.
[ERROR] Re-run Maven using the -X switch to enable full debug logging.
[ERROR]
[ERROR] For more information about the errors and possible sliutions, please read the flilowing articles:
[ERROR] [Help 1]
<a href="http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException" target="_blank">http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/MojoExecutionException</a> 
</code></pre>
<p>There will be a lot of useful information in the log, over time you will learn to understand and appreciate it.</p>
<h2>5.3 Work cycles</h2>
<p>All maven commands are divided into three groups - lifecycles. They are called <strong>lifecycles</strong> because they specify the order of the phases that run during a build or a particular lifecycle because not all Maven activities are builds.</p>
<p>There are three life cycles:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>clean;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>default;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>site.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And each of them has its own phase order. Clean has the shortest:</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>pre clean;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>clean;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>post clean.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Hidden additional pre-clean and post-clean phases have been added so that the cleanup scenario can be made more flexible.</p>
<p>Then comes <span class="text-user">the site life cycle</span> , which, as you already know, is designed to automatically generate project documentation. It consists of four phases:</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>pre-site</strong></li>
 <li><strong>site;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>post-site;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>site-deploy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Standard life cycles can be enhanced with functionality using <strong>Maven plugins</strong> . We will talk about this later, because this is a very interesting topic that deserves a separate lecture.</p>
<p>And the default script has the longest list of phases:</p>
<ol>
 <li><strong>validate;</strong></li><span class="text-green">
  <li><strong>generate-sources;</strong></li></span> <span class="text-green">
  <li><strong>process-sources;</strong></li></span> <span class="text-user">
  <li><strong>generate-resources;</strong></li></span> <span class="text-user">
  <li><strong>process-resources;</strong></li></span>
 <li><strong>compile;</strong></li><span class="text-orange">
  <li><strong>process-test-sources;</strong></li></span> <span class="text-orange">
  <li><strong>process-test-resources;</strong></li></span> <span class="text-orange">
  <li><strong>test compile;</strong></li></span>
 <li><strong>test;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>package;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>install;</strong></li>
 <li><strong>deploy.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are all the same phases that you already know about, but a few more optional ones have been added.</p>
<p>First, a popular stage in large projects is <strong>generate-sources</strong> : generating Java code based on XML, for example. And a pair of <strong>process-sources</strong> , which does something with this code.</p>
<p>Secondly, the generation of resources is <strong>generate-resources</strong> and its paired <strong>process resources</strong> method . You will often see some activities tied to these phases in large projects.</p>
<p>And finally, testing. It has three additional optional phases that help make running the test phase as flexible as possible: process-test-sources, process-test-resources, test-compile.</p>
