Multithreading Issues: Accessing a Shared Resource
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Threads, of course, are cool and open up a world of incredible possibilities and ... a heap of complexities for programmers. Different threads change the state of different objects in accordance with the task that each of them performs. And, of course, they can interfere with each other! But the worst happens deep inside the Java machine... Sounds intriguing?
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hello, Amigo! Yesterday we discussed the benefits and conveniences of multithreading. Now it's time to look at the disadvantages. And, unfortunately, they are not small."</p>
<p><strong>Previously, we looked at a program as a set of objects that call each other's methods.</strong> Now everything gets a little more complicated. A program is more like a set of objects that has several "small robots" (threads) crawling through it and executing the commands contained in the methods.</p>
<p>This new interpretation doesn't cancel the first. They are still objects, and they still call each other's methods. <span class="text-red">But we have to remember that there are several threads, and each thread does its own job or task.</span></p>
<p>A program is becoming more complicated. <span class="text-red">Different threads change the state of different objects based on the tasks they perform. And they can step on each other's toes.</span></p>
<p>But the worst stuff happens deep inside the Java machine. As I've said already, the apparent simultaneity of threads is achieved by the fact that the processor constantly switches from one thread to another. It switches to a thread, works for 10 milliseconds, switches to the next thread, works for 10 milliseconds, and so on. And herein lies the problem: these switches can occur at the most inopportune moments. Consider this example:</p>
