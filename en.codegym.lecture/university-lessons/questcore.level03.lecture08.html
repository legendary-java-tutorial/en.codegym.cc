Standard interfaces: InputStream, OutputStream
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Once upon a time there were InputStream and OutputStream. They are declared as abstract classes, but if you look closely, they seem to be real interfaces. Almost all of their methods are abstract except for a few minor methods. Attention, the question is: what is their peculiarity and why are they still made abstract classes?
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hello, Amigo! Now I'll tell you about two interfaces: <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong>. They are declared as abstract classes, but if you dig deeper you can see that <strong>they are essentially interfaces</strong>. Almost all of their methods are abstract, except for a few insignificant methods. They are very much like the "<strong>bodyguard</strong>" we considered earlier."</p>
<p>These are very interesting interfaces. For now, I'm going to deliberately call them <strong>interfaces</strong>, so you understand why we need them. And then we'll talk about why they are actually abstract classes.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Okay. So what are these interfaces?"</span></p>
<p>"I'll tell you without further ado."</p>
<p>Java has this interesting thing called a «<strong>stream</strong>». <strong>A stream</strong> is a very simple entity. And its simplicity is the key for a very powerful way to exchange data. There are two types of streams: <strong>streams for reading and streams for writing</strong>.</p>
<p>As you probably already guessed, you can write data to <strong>a stream for writing</strong>. It has a <strong>write</strong> method for this. You can read data from <strong>a stream for reading</strong>. It has a <strong>read</strong>() method for this.</p>
<p><strong>InputStream</strong> is the interface for a stream that supports reading. It defines the following ability: «bytes can be read from me».</p>
<p>Similarly, <strong>OutputStream</strong>, an OutputStream is an interface for a stream that supports writing. It defines the following ability: «bytes can be written to me».</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's it?"</span></p>
<p>"Pretty much. But the whole point is that Java has loads of classes that can work with <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong>. For example, you want to read a file from disk and display its contents on the screen. Nothing could be easier."</p>
<p>To read data from a file on disk, we have the special <strong>FileInputStream</strong> class, which implements the <strong>InputStream</strong> interface. Do you want to write this data to another file? For this, we have the <strong>FileOutputStream</strong> class, which implements the <strong>OutputStream</strong> interface. The following code shows what you need to do to copy data from one file to another.</p>
<div class="code-heading">Code</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException
{
 <strong>InputStream <span class="text-green">inStream</span></strong> = new <strong>FileInputStream</strong>("c:/source.txt");
 <strong>OutputStream <span class="text-user">outStream</span></strong> = new <strong>FileOutputStream</strong>("c:/result.txt");

 while (<strong><span class="text-green">inStream</span></strong>.<strong>available</strong>() &gt; 0)
 {
  int data = <strong><span class="text-green">inStream</span>.<span class="text-red">read</span></strong>(); //read one byte from the input stream
  <strong><span class="text-user">outStream</span>.<span class="text-red">write</span></strong>(data); //write that byte to the other stream.
 }

 <strong><span class="text-green">inStream</span></strong>.close(); //close the streams
 <strong><span class="text-user">outStream</span></strong>.close();
}</code></pre>
<p>Imagine that we've written a class and added the <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong> abilities to it.</p>
<p>If we properly implemented these interfaces, then instances of our class can now be saved to or read from a file. Simply by reading their contents using the <strong>read</strong> method. Or they can be loaded from a file by creating an object and using the write method to <strong>write</strong> the file contents.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Maybe an example?"</span></p>
<p>"Sure."</p>

        <td>For simplicity, imagine that our class contains one object, an ArrayList that holds Integers.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

<p>Now we'll add read and write methods to it</p>

return first;

public int available()

        </td>
        <td>Now our class implements the <strong>read</strong> method, which makes it possible to sequentially read the entire contents of <strong>list</strong>.</p>
            <p>And the <strong>write</strong> method, which lets you write values to our list.</td>
    </tr>

<p>Of course, this isn't an implementation of the InputStream and OutputStream interfaces, but it's very similar.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, I understand. So how do you save the contents of such an object to a file?"</span></p>
<p>"Let me give you an example:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Write a MyClass object to a file</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code><strong>public static</strong> void main(String[] args)
{
 <strong>MyClass</strong> <strong><span class="text-green">myObject</span></strong> = <strong>new <span class="text-green">MyClass</span></strong>();
 <strong>OutputStream <span class="text-user">outStream</span></strong> = new <span class="text-yellow"><strong>FileOutputStream</span></strong> ("c:/my-object-data.txt");

 while (<strong><span class="text-green">myObject</span>.available</strong>() &gt; 0)
 {
  int data = <span class="text-green"><strong>myObject</strong></span>.<span class="text-red"><strong>read</strong></span>(); //read one int from the input stream
  <strong><span class="text-user">outStream</span>.<span class="text-red">write</span></strong>(data); //write that int to the other stream.
 }

 <span class="text-user"><strong>outStream</strong></span>.close();
}</code></pre>

 }

 <span class="text-green"><strong>inStream</strong></span>.close(); //close the streams

<p><span class="text-user">"Holy moly! It really is very similar to working with InputStream/OutputStream. Streams are sweet!"</span></p>
