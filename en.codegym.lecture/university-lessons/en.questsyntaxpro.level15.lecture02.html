<h2>1. <code>InputStreamReader</code> class</h2>
<p>Another interesting feature of streams is that you can combine multiple streams together into <strong>chains</strong>. A stream can read data not only from its internal data source, but also from <strong>another stream</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful mechanism in Java, which makes it possible to create complex data reading scenarios by connecting one stream to another. Such a scheme looks like this:</p>
<p><img data-max-width="1024" data-id="15d72c1b-b4d5-42d6-bb9b-d72968d04bbf" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/15d72c1b-b4d5-42d6-bb9b-d72968d04bbf/1024.jpeg" alt="InputStreamReader class"></p>
<p>When a program reads data from a data stream, the data stream in turn reads the data from its data source, which is another data stream or a file, for example.</p>
<p>What's more, each data stream not only reads in and gives out data, but can also transform it or perform various operations on it. A good example of such an "intermediate stream" is the <code>InputStreamReader</code> class.</p>
<p>We already know a class called <code>FileReader</code> — it is a <code>Reader</code> that reads data from a file. And where does <code>InputStreamReader</code> get its data from? That's right — from an <code>InputStream</code>.</p>
<p>When you create an <code>InputStreamReader</code> object, you need to pass in an <code>InputStream</code> object or one of its descendant classes. Example:</p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>String <span class="code text-green">src</span> = "c:\\projects\\log.txt";
<span class="text-viola">FileInputStream</span> <span class="code text-user">input</span> = new <span class="text-viola">FileInputStream</span>(<span class="code text-green">src</span>);
<span class="text-neon">InputStreamReader</span> <span class="code text-orange">reader</span> = new <span class="text-neon">InputStreamReader</span>(<span class="code text-user">input</span>);</code></pre>
<p>The <code>InputStreamReader</code> class has all the methods that the <code>Reader</code> class has, and they work in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>The main difference between the <code>InputStreamReader</code> class and, say, <code>FileReader</code> is where they read data from. <code>FileReader</code> reads data from a file (duh — that's why it's called <code>FileReader</code>), but <code>InputStreamReader</code> reads data from an <code>InputStream</code>.</p>
<p><span class="text-green">When you read a character from a <code><span class="text-green">FileReader</span></code> object using the <code><span class="text-green">read()</span></code> method, it in turn reads two bytes from the file on disk and returns them as <code><span class="text-green">chars</span></code>.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-viola">When you read a character from an <code><span class="text-viola">InputStreamReader</span></code> object using the <code><span class="text-viola">read()</span></code> method, it in turn reads two bytes from the <code><span class="text-viola">FileInputStream</span></code> object passed to it, which in turn reads data from the file. </span>The result is a <strong>chain of calls</strong> to <code>read()</code> methods.</p>

<h2>2. <code>BufferedReader</code> class</h2>
<p>Another interesting class that you are likely to use a lot is <code>BufferedReader</code>. This is also an "intermediate stream" that reads data from another stream.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the <code>BufferedReader</code> class is a subclass of <code>Reader</code> and <span class="text-green">lets you read characters</span>. But what is most interesting is that you also need to pass it a data source in the form of a <span class="text-viola">stream from which characters can be read</span>, i.e. a stream that inherits the <code>Reader</code> class.</p>
<p>What's the point? Unlike <code>InputStreamReader</code>, the <code>BufferedReader</code> class does not convert bytes to characters: it doesn't convert anything at all. Instead, it <span class="term">buffers data</span>.</p>
<p><img width="800" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/e76d67f1-5741-44e3-ad9d-114e7a0ae230/800.webp" alt=""></p>
<p>When a program reads a single character from a <code>BufferedReader</code> object, the object reads a large array of characters from its source stream all at once. And stores them internally.</p>
<p>When the next character is read from the <code>BufferedReader</code> object, it simply grabs the next character from its internal buffer array and returns it without accessing the data source. Only when all the characters in the buffer are used up does it read in another large array of characters.</p>
<p>The <code>BufferedReader</code> class also has a very useful method — <code>String readLine()</code>, which lets you read entire strings of data from the source stream all at once. You can use this method to, say, read a file and display its contents on the screen line by line. Example:</p>
<p>We specifically wrote some compact code to illustrate how convenient this can be. This code could also be written with a little more detail.</p>

<h2>3. Reading from the console</h2>
<p>And one more interesting fact: the <code>Scanner</code> class is nothing more than an intermediate input stream that reads data from <code>System.in</code>, which is also a data stream.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to read a line from the console:</p>

    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Scanner class</th>
        <th>BufferedReader and BufferedWriter classes</th>

String <span class="code text-green">line</span> = <span class="code text-user">buff</span>.<span class="text-red">readLine</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>

<p>Our friend <code><span class="text-neon">System</span>.<span class="text-green">in</span></code> is nothing more than a static <code><span class="text-green">in</span></code> variable of the <code><span class="text-neon">System</span></code> class. It is an <code><span class="text-user">InputStream</span></code> whose name is <code><span class="text-green">in</span></code>.</p>
<p>So almost from the very beginning of your Java studies on CodeGym, you have been working with data streams and build chains from them. But now you will do it more consciously.</p>
