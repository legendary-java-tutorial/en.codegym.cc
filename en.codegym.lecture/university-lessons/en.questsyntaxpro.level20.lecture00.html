<h2>1. Programming for grown-ups</h2>
<p>Until recently, you only wrote programs on the CodeGym website. This was simple, convenient, and understandable. But you don't think that you will always do this, do you? It's time to start writing programs like an adult, just like real programmers. Somehow people were writing programs before CodeGym was created!</p>
<p>To write a program on your computer without CodeGym, you need to do two things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Install the <span class="term text-user">Java JDK</span></li>
    <li>Install the <span class="term text-red">Java IDE</span></li>
</ol>
<p>What is these things?</p>
<p><strong>Java JDK</strong><br>
    A program written in Java is different from an ordinary computer program. An ordinary program contains <span class="term text-brown">machine code</span> that can be executed directly by a computer processor and doesn't require any additional manipulation to run.</p>
<p>A program written in Java doesn't contain machine code. Instead, it contains special <span class="term text-neon">bytecode</span>. The processor doesn't know how to execute <span class="term text-neon">bytecode</span>, so when executing a Java program, it first launches a special program, the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span>. And it is the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> that understands <span class="term text-neon">bytecode</span> and knows how to execute it. The <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> is part of the <span class="term text-user">JDK</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Java IDE</strong></p>
<p>Modern programs contain millions of lines of code. It would be impossible to write such programs using a basic text editor. Instead, coders use powerful software tools that greatly speed up and simplify their work.</p>
<p>These programs for creating programs are usually called <span class="term">IDE</span>s. <span class="term text-red">IDE</span> stands for <span class="term">Integrated Development Environment</span>.</p>
<p>There are 3 popular <span class="term text-red">IDE</span>s for writing Java programs:</p>
<ol>
    <li><span class="term">IntelliJ IDEA</span></li>
    <li><span class="term">Eclipse</span></li>
    <li><span class="term">NetBeans</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Almost everybody prefers <span class="term">IntelliJ IDEA</span>. Once you get to know it, you will understand why. But first you need to deal with the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> and <span class="term text-user">JDK</span>.</p>

<h2>2. What is the <span class="term">JDK</span>?</h2>
<p><span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> stands for Java virtual machine. A regular processor executes machine code, but the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> executes <span class="term text-neon">bytecode</span> This means that the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> is like a virtual processor/computer.</p>
<p>You'll find that programmers quite often refer to computers/processors as machines. Get used to it: you are also one of them now.</p>
<p>The <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> is good thing, but the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> alone is useless. Nobody needs a bare processor either. The <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> is typically paired with a set of standard libraries, which include all kinds of collections, lists, and other classes. By the way, a standard library contains several thousands of classes.</p>
<p>The <span class="term text-orange">JRE</span> stands for <span class="term text-green">Java Runtime Environment</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="term text-green">JRE</span> is enough to run lots of Java programs, but it isn't for programmers. For example, the <span class="term">Java compiler</span> is not included in the <span class="term text-green">JRE</span>. And where do you get it?</p>
<p>Java developers have their very own toolkit, the <span class="term text-user">JDK</span> (<span class="term">Java Development Kit</span>). The <span class="term text-user">JDK</span> includes the <span class="term text-green">JRE </span> and the <span class="term">Java-compiler</span> along with other programs that are super useful for Java devs. Here's what the big picture looks like:</p>

<p>The <span class="term text-user">JDK</span> contains the <span class="term text-green">JRE</span> plus tools for Java developers.</p>
<p>The <span class="term text-green">JRE</span> contains the <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> plus a set of standard Java libraries.</p>
<p>The <span class="term text-orange">JVM</span> is the <span class="term">Java Virtual Machine</span>.</p>

<h2>3. Variants of the <span class="term">JDK</span></h2>
<p>The time has passed when a new version of Java appeared every 3-5 years, and it was a major event. Now a new version of the <span class="term text-user">JDK</span> is released every six months. Google Chrome's example turned out to be contagious :) Additionally, different companies produce their own <span class="term text-user">JDK</span>s.</p>
<p>Microsoft was the first to do this in the late 1990s to crush the increasingly popular Java platform that made programs independent of Windows. Of course, Microsoft lost in court and was forced to release its own more independent Java analogues: the .NET platform and the C# language.</p>
<p>The .NET platform is Microsoft's counterpart to the JRE, and the C# language's initial versions had a one-to-one mapping to the Java language. That said, a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then.</p>
<p>In any case, today there are several popular <span class="term text-user">JDK</span>s. We are interested in two of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="term">Oracle JDK</span> is the official <span class="term text-user">JDK</span> from the company that created Java. Corporate use now requires some payment, but it is still free for private use and individual developers.</li>
    <li><span class="term">OpenJDK</span> is a free <span class="term text-user">JDK</span>, also released by Oracle. It is the favorite of developers and companies that don't want to pay money to Oracle.</li>
</ul>
<p>For developers, there is no fundamental difference, so you can safely use OpenJDK.</p>

<h2>4. Installing the <span class="term">JDK</span></h2>
<p>You need to download <strong>OpenJDK 16</strong> to your computer. First, go <a href="https://jdk.java.net/16/" target="_blank">https://jdk.java.net/16/</a></p>
<p>In the "Builds" section, click on the JDK version for your OS to start the download.</p>
<img data-max-width="1080" data-id="9a723154-85d0-4d59-9a21-0ae09494bc02" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/9a723154-85d0-4d59-9a21-0ae09494bc02/1080.jpeg" alt="">
<p>It's a good idea to move the downloaded archive to a safe place before unzipping it in order to be sure you don't accidentally delete it.<p/>
<p>IMPORTANT! Be sure you don't have any Cyrillic characters in the path to the JDK. Cyrillic characters will cause problems with launching programs. </p>
