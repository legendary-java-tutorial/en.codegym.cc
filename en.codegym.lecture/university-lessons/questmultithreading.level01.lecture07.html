Clone method, Cloneable interface
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Hello Amigo! - Hello, Kim. — I'll tell you about the clone() method. The purpose of this method is to clone an object - i.e. create its clone/copy/duplicate. If it is called, the Java machine will create and return a duplicate of the object on which this method was called. Cloning an object in the Object class is implemented in a very primitive way - when cloning, only one new object is created: ...

<p>"Hi, Amigo!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hi, Kim."</span></p>
<p>"I'm going to tell you about the clone() method."</p>
<p>"The point of this method is to clone an object, or in other words, to create a clone/copy/duplicate of the object."</p>
<p>"When this method is called, the Java virtual machine creates and returns a duplicate of the object it is called on.</p>
<p>The Object class's implementation of the clone method is very primitive: only one new object is created, and the values of the original object's fields are assigned to its fields.</p>
<p>If the copied object contains references to other objects, then those references will be copied. Duplicates of those objects will not be created."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm. That's not much to go on."</span></p>
<p>"The thing is, the Java virtual machine doesn't know which objects can or can't be cloned. For example, files can't be cloned. The same is true for a System.in stream."</p>
<p>"So, the question of full-fledged cloning was punted to a class's developers. "This is all similar to how the equals method is handled. There's even something comparable to hashCode: the Cloneable interface."</p>
<p>"The <strong>Cloneable</strong> interface is what's called a 'marker interface': it doesn't have any methods and is used to mark certain classes.</p>
<p>"If a class's developer believes objects of the class can be cloned, he marks it with this interface (i.e. makes the class implement Cloneable)."</p>
<p>"If the developer doesn't like the clone method's standard implementation, he must write his own that will create a duplicate object in the right way."</p>
<p>"When you call the <strong>clone</strong>() method, Java checks whether the object supports the Cloneable interface. If it does, then it clones the object using the <strong>clone</strong>() method; if not, it throws a CloneNotSupportedException."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"In other words, we must either override the clone method or make the class implement Cloneable?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes, but you still have to override the method. The clone() method is declared as protected, so it can only be called by classes in its package (java.lang.*) or their subclasses."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm a little confused—so what do I need to do to clone an object?"</span></p>
<p>"If you want to use the Object class's «default» cloning method, you need to:</p>
<p>"<strong>a)</strong> Add the Cloneable interface to your class"</p>
<p>"<strong>b)</strong> Override the clone method and call the superclass's implementation within your implementation:"</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class Point implements Cloneable
{
 int x;
 int y;

 public Object clone()
 {
  return super.clone();
 }</span>
    }</code></pre>
<p>"Or you can write a implementation of the clone method entirely on your own:"</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class Point
{
 int x;
 int y;

 public Object clone()
 {
  Point point = new Point();
  point.x = this.x;
  point.y = this.y;
  return point;
 }
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's an interesting method. I'm sure I'll use it. Occasionally…"</span></p>
