Useful links from the Professor — 15
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Of course, looking at the same material from different angles is useful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps for you the best source of the theory will be different from the source best suited to your friend. Especially for you, the Professor found a very interesting lesson that will teach you more about overriding methods and constructors.

<p><span class="text-user">"Hello, Professor!"</span></p>
<p>"Well, hello, Amigo! It seems you've grown a little since our last meeting…" </p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Professor, I saw you yesterday :) I've come to you for new lessons."</span></p>
<p>"What would you like to know, Amigo?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"It seems I didn't fully understand access modifiers and how they're used."</span></p>
<p>"So that's it! Let me think... Right! I have what you need. And, I think, there's something else that will help you best understand the topic taught on this level. </p>
<p><big><strong>Access modifiers. Private, protected, default, public</strong></big></p> 
<p>In this lesson, we'll get acquainted with the concept of access modifiers and consider examples of how to work with them. You already know that there are four modifiers that control access to different parts of your code. This time <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/107-access-modifiers-private-protected-default-public' target='_blank'>we will analyze in detail</a> the circumstances in which they may come in handy.</p>
<p><big><strong>Sequence of actions during object creation</strong></big></p>
<p>Today your awareness of Java will now allow us to talk in more detail about creating objects. <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/249-sequence-of-actions-during-object-creation' target='_blank'>In an article</a>, we'll consider this process in full: how constructors are called, how and in what order fields (including static fields) are initialized, and so on. </p>
