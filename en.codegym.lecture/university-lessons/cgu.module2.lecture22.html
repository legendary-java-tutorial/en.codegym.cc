newFixedThreadPool method
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
The newFixedThreadPool method of the Executors class will create an executorService for us with a fixed number of threads. Compared to the newSingleThreadExecutor method, we specify how many threads we want to see in the pool. Called under the hood...
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>The <span class="code text-orange">newFixedThreadPool</span> method of the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">Executors</span></span> class creates an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executorService</em></span></span> with a fixed number of threads. Unlike the <span class="code text-orange">newSingleThreadExecutor</span> method, we specify how many threads we want in the pool. Under the hood, the following code is called:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
new ThreadPoolExecutor(nThreads, nThreads,
                                      	0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
                                      	new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());</code></pre>

    <p>The <span class="text-green">corePoolSize</span> (the number of threads that will be ready (started) when the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executor</em></span></span> service starts) and <span class="text-green">maximumPoolSize</span> (the maximum number of threads that the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executor</em></span></span> service can create) parameters receive the same value — the number of threads passed to <span class="code text-orange">newFixedThreadPool(nThreads)</span>. And we can pass our own implementation of <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ThreadFactory</em></span></span> in exactly the same way.</p>

    <p>Well, let's see why we need such an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>
 
    <p>Here's the logic of an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> with a fixed number (n) of threads:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A maximum of n threads will be active for processing tasks.</li>
        <li>If more than n tasks are submitted, they will be held in the queue until threads become free.</li>
        <li>If one of the threads fails and terminates, a new thread will be created to take its place.</li>
        <li>Any thread in the pool is active until the pool is shut down.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As an example, imagine waiting to go through security at the airport. Everyone stands in one line until immediately before the security check, passengers are distributed among all the working checkpoints. If there is a delay at one of the checkpoints, the queue will be processed by only the second one until the first one is free. And if one checkpoint closes entirely, then another checkpoint will be opened to replace it, and passengers will continue to be processed through two checkpoints. </p>

    <p>We'll note right away that even if conditions are ideal — the promised n threads work stably, and threads that end with an error are always replaced (something that limited resources make impossible to achieve in a real airport) — the system still has several unpleasant features, because under no circumstances will there be more threads, even if the queue grows faster than the threads can process tasks.</p>
 
    <p>I suggest getting a practical understanding of how <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> works with a fixed number of threads. Let's create a class that implements <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Runnable</em></span></span>. Objects of this class represent our tasks for the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
public class Task implements Runnable {
    int taskNumber;
 
    public Task(int taskNumber) {
        this.taskNumber = taskNumber;
    }
 
    @Override
    public void run() {
try {
            TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Processed user request #" + taskNumber + " on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
    </code></pre>
 
    <p>In the <span class="code text-orange">run()</span> method, we block the thread for 2 seconds, simulating some workload, and then display the current task's number and the name of the thread executing the task.</p>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
 
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++) {
            executorService.execute(new Task(i));
        }
        
        executorService.shutdown();
    </code></pre>
 
    <p>To begin with, in the <span class="code text-orange">main</span> method, we create an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> and submit 30 tasks for execution. </p>

    <p>The console output shows us how the tasks are executed on different threads once they are released by the previous task. </p>
 
    <p>Now we'll increase the number of tasks to 100, and after submitting 100 tasks, we'll call the <span class="code text-orange">awaitTermination(11, SECONDS)</span> method. We pass a number and time unit as arguments. This method will block the main thread for 11 seconds. Then we will call <span class="code text-orange">shutdownNow()</span> to force the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> to shut down without waiting for all tasks to complete. </p>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
 
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
            executorService.execute(new Task(i));
        }
 
        executorService.awaitTermination(11, SECONDS);
 
        executorService.shutdownNow();
        System.out.println(executorService);
    </code></pre>
 
    <p>At the end, we'll display information about the state of the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executorService</em></span></span>. </p>
 
    <p>Here's the console output we get:</p>
 
    <div class="terminal">Processed user request #0 on pool-1-thread-1 thread<br />

    <p>This is followed by 3 <span class="text-red"><span class="text-bold">InterruptedExceptions</span></span>, thrown by <span class="code text-orange">sleep</span> methods from 3 active tasks.</p>
 
    <p>We can see that when the program ends, 15 tasks are done, but the pool still had 3 active threads that did not finish executing their tasks. The <span class="code text-orange">interrupt()</span> method is called on these three threads, which means that the task will complete, but in our case, the <span class="code text-orange">sleep</span> method throws an <span class="text-red"><span class="text-bold">InterruptedException</span></span>. We also see that after the <span class="code text-orange">shutdownNow()</span> method is called, the task queue is cleared. </p>
 
    <p>So when using an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> with a fixed number of threads in the pool, be sure to remember how it works. This type is suitable for tasks with a known constant load.</p>

    <p>Here's another interesting question: if you need to use an executor for a single thread, which method should you call? <span class="code text-orange">newSingleThreadExecutor()</span> or <span class="code text-orange">newFixedThreadPool(1)</span>?</p>

    <p>Both executors will have equivalent behavior. The only difference is that the <span class="code text-orange">newSingleThreadExecutor()</span> method will return an executor that cannot be later reconfigured to use additional threads.</p>
