Looking at the same material from different angles is helpful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps the best source of theory for you is different from the one that suits your friend. Especially for you, the professor found a very interesting lecture on the net, from which you will learn a lot about threads.

<p>"Greetings, Amigo! Tell me about your progress. What did you study this week?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Ellie, Rishi, Doctor Bilaabo, and I talked about multithreading. I learned a lot!"</span></p>
<p>"My dear friend, I think I have something to expand your understanding. Some more theory will do you good. Sit back. I've got something to tell you.</p>
<p><big><strong>Multithreading in Java: what it is, its benefits and common pitfalls</strong></big></p> 
<p>You now know that programming has a way to perform multiple actions at the same time — in parallel — rather than in a strict sequence. This makes it easier to solve many tasks. But it isn't all smooth sailing. Multithreading has some traps that can catch not only beginners, but also experienced programmers. <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/108-multithreading-in-java-what-it-is-its-benefits-and-common-pitfalls' target='_blank'>We'll explain</a> how to not create problems for yourself.</p>
<p><big><strong>What the methods of the Thread class do</strong></big></p>
<p><a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/109-multithreading-what-the-methods-of-the-thread-class-do' target='_blank'>This lesson</a> will teach you about some of the Thread class's methods for starting and pausing threads. Their logic differs from other methods, so we've prepared loads of examples.</p>
