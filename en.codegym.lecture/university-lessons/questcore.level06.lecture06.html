healthy sleep
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Even programs need to sleep sometimes. And threads - even more so. To send a thread to sleep, Java has a sleep method. It is declared as a static method of the Thread class. This means that it is not attached to any object. The purpose of this method is to make the program "fall asleep" for a while. How it works? Learn from the lecture!

<p>"Hello, Amigo! Today Bilaabo will tell you about the most interesting method we use when working with threads: <span class="text-red"><strong>sleep</strong></span>. <span class="text-red">The <strong>sleep</strong> method is declared as a static method of the Thread class</span>, i.e. it is not attached to any object. The purpose of this method is to make <span class="text-red">the program «fall asleep»</span> for a while. Here's how it works:"</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Code</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>public static void main(String[] args)
{
<span class="text-red">Thread.sleep(</span>2000<span class="text-red">);</span>
}</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td><p>The program starts.</p>
            <p>Then it freezes for 2 seconds (2,000 milliseconds)</p>
            <p>Then it ends.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <strong>sleep</strong> method's only parameter is a length of time. The time interval is specified in thousandths of a second (milliseconds). Once a thread calls this method, it falls asleep for the specified number of milliseconds.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"When is it best to use this method?"</span></p>
<p>"This method is often used in child threads when you need to do something regularly but not too often. Look at this example:"</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Code</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>public static void main(String[] args)
{
<span class="text-user">while (true)</span>
{
<span class="text-red">Thread.sleep</span>(500);
System.out.println("Tick");
}
}</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td><span class="text-user">The program will run forever.</span> The loop condition is always true.</p>
            <p>Here's what the program does in the loop:<br />
                a) <span class="text-red">sleep for half a second</span><br />
                b) display «Tick» on the screen</p>
            <p>That is, some action will be performed twice a second.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><span class="text-user">"Ooh, now that's interesting."</span></p>
<p>"Glad you like it, my friend!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What if I want to perform an action 100 times a second. What should I do?"</span></p>
<p>"If an action should be executed 100 times per second and there are 1000 milliseconds in a second, then the action needs to be performed once every 10 milliseconds."</p>
<p>If your <strong>action</strong> takes 2 milliseconds, then you should add an 8-millisecond delay. Taken together, they will be executed every 10 milliseconds. And that works out to 100 times per second.</p>
<p>If your action is almost instantaneous, add a 10-millisecond delay (sleep). Then it will be executed about 100 times per second.</p>
