<h2>3. Wrapping exceptions</h2>
<p><span class="term">Checked</span> exceptions seemed cool in theory, but turned out to be a huge frustration in practice.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a super popular method in your project. It is called from hundreds of places in your program. And you decide to add a new <span class="term">checked</span> exception to it. And it may well be that this <span class="term">checked</span> exception is really important and so special that only the <code>main()</code> method knows what to do if it is caught.</p>
<p>That means <span class="text-orange">you'll have to add the <span class="term"><span class="text-orange">checked</span></span> exception to the <code>throws</code> clause of every method that calls your super popular method</span>. As well as in the <code>throws</code> clause of all the methods that call those methods. And of the methods that call those methods.</p>
<p>As a result, the <code>throws</code> clauses of half of the methods in the project get a new <span class="term">checked</span> exception. And of course your project is covered by tests, and now the tests don't compile. And now you have to edit the throws clauses in your tests as well.</p>
<p><span class="text-green">And then all your code (all the changes in hundreds of files) will have to be reviewed by other programmers. </span>And at this point we ask ourselves why we made we made so many bloody changes to the project? Day(s?) of work, and broken tests — all for the sake of adding one <span class="term">checked</span> exception?</p>
<p>And of course, there are still problems related to inheritance and method overriding. <span class="text-red">The problems that come from <span class="term">checked</span> exceptions are much larger than the benefit.</span> The bottom line is that now few people love them and few people use them.</p>
<p>However, there is still a lot of code (including standard Java library code) that contains these <span class="term">checked</span> exceptions. What is to be done with them? We can't ignore them, and we don't know how to handle them.</p>
<p>Java programmers proposed to wrap <span class="term">checked</span> exceptions in <code>RuntimeException</code>. In other words, catch all the <span class="term">checked</span> exceptions and then create <span class="term">unchecked</span> exceptions (for example, <code>RuntimeException</code>) and throw them instead. Doing that looks something like this:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
<pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code>try
{
   <span class="text-green">// Code where a checked exception might occur</span>
}
catch(<span class="text-neon">Exception exp</span>)
{
   throw new <span class="text-viola">RuntimeException</span>(<span class="text-viola">exp</span>);
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>It's not a very pretty solution, but there's nothing criminal here: the exception was simply stuffed inside a <code>RuntimeException</code>.</p>
<p>If desired, you can easily retrieve it from there. Example:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Code</th>
        <th>Note</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="language-java"><code>try
{
   // Code where we wrap the checked exception
   // in a RuntimeException
}
catch(<span class="text-viola">RuntimeException</span> <span class="code"><span class="text-viola">e</span></span>)
{
   Throwable <span class="code"><span class="text-green">cause</span></span> = <span class="code"><span class="text-viola">e</span></span>.getCause();
   if (<span class="code"><span class="text-green">cause</span></span> instanceof <span class="text-neon">Exception</span>)
   {
      <span class="text-neon">Exception <span class="code">exp</span></span> = (<span class="text-neon">Exception</span>) <span class="code"><span class="text-green">cause</span></span>;
      // Exception handling code goes here
   }
}</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Get the exception stored inside the <code>RuntimeException</code> object. The <code><span class="text-green">cause</span></code> variable maybe <code>null</code><br><br>
            Determine its type and convert it to a <span class="term">checked</span> exception type.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
