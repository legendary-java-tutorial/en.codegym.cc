ThreadGroup - thread groups
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Hello Amigo! Let's start to deal with the threads thoroughly. So that any thread could not stop and interrupt all threads in a row, the concept of a “group of threads” was introduced. A thread can only affect other threads that are in the same group as it. ThreadGroup is a class that manages groups of threads. This approach allows you to protect the threads from ...

<p>"Hi, Amigo!"</p>
<p>"We're going to start a more thorough exploration of threads."</p>
<p>"The concept of a thread group was introduced to prevent a thread from repeatedly stopping and interrupting every other thread. A thread can only affect other threads in the same thread group. ThreadGroup is a class for managing thread groups. This approach lets you protect threads from unwanted changes."</p>
<p>"Sometimes you have to run code that you can't fully trust. So it's convenient to put all of its threads in a separate group and block them from interfering with the work of the main thread group."</p>
<p>"A thread group can contain other groups. This lets you organize all your threads and groups in a hierarchical tree. In such a tree, each thread group (except the initial group) has its own parent."</p>
<p>"The ThreadGroup class has methods that let you get lists of all threads and affect/change them. When we create a new thread without explicitly specifying a group, it joins the same group as the creator thread."</p>
<p>"Here are some of the methods in the ThreadGroup class:"</p>
