<p>When writing code with a lot of conditions, surely you have used either an <span class="text-viola">if-else</span> or a <span class="text-viola">switch</span> statement. But this alternative to the <span class="text-viola">if-else</span> has drawbacks. Some people have even called the <span class="text-viola">switch</span> statement an "anti-pattern". </p>

<p>But there is good news: new versions of Java have brought a lot of changes in the language's syntax, and one of those changes affects <span class="text-viola">switch</span>. Intrigued? Then let's go dive in.</p>

<p>To begin with, it is worth clarifying why <span class="text-viola">switch</span> is an anti-pattern. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
switch (condition) {
    case "DECEMBER":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    case "JANUARY":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    case "FEBRUARY":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    default:
        seasonNumber = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so it's not yet entirely clear why this is an "anti-pattern". </p>

<p>But what if we add more <span class="text-viola">case</span> blocks and now the code looks like this:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
switch (condition) {
    case "DECEMBER":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    case "JANUARY":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    case "FEBRUARY":
        seasonNumber = 1;
        break;
    case “MARCH”:
        seasonNumber = 2;
        break;
    case “APRIL”:
        seasonNumber = 2;
        break;
    case “MAY”:
        seasonNumber = 2;
        break;
    default:
        seasonNumber = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's add a few more lines — the code grows longer. Later we can add more and more lines, and no one will stop us from doing this. </p>

<p>This is the heart of the problem: after initially creating a compact <span class="text-viola">switch</span> statement, we add more and more code to it, taking up more and more space — more than will fit on the screen — and making the code inconvenient to read and maintain. </p>

<h2>Difference between the switch statement and switch expression</h2>

<p>Java 14 introduced a new and improved switch. It is not a <span class="text-viola">switch statement</span>, but rather a <span class="text-viola">switch expression</span>. </p>

<p>What's the difference, you ask? The difference is that a statement is an instruction that performs a certain set of operations, but an expression is a piece of code that performs some calculation and returns a result.</p>

<p>In other words, now you can save the result of a <span class="text-viola">switch</span> to a variable. </p>

<p>Enough talking. Now let's see what the new <span class="text-viola">switch</span> looks like: </p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
var result = switch(month) {
     case DECEMBER, JANUARY, FEBRUARY -&gt; 1;
     case MARCH, APRIL, MAY -&gt; 2;
    case JUNE, JULY, AUGUST -&gt; 3;
    case SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER -&gt; 4;
    default -&gt; 0; 
};
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing that catches your eye is how compact the code is. Code that used to take up most of the screen now spans a few lines and looks much more readable. </p>

<h2>-&gt; operator</h2>

<p>You should also note the <span class="text-viola">-&gt;</span> operator (arrow operator). You may already be familiar with it if you have experience with lambda expressions. </p>

<p>That means now you can write a cool-looking <span class="text-viola">switch</span> in the style of a lambda statement. The arrow operator indicates that the compiler will not proceed to the next <span class="text-viola">case</span> expression (if the current <span class="text-viola">case</span> block lacks a <span class="text-viola">break</span> or <span class="text-viola">return</span> statement), but will instead give you the value of the expression to the right of the arrow.</p>

<p>You can also write code that is not an expression and simply performs certain actions instead of returning anything:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
switch(condition) {
    case TRUE, FALSE -&gt; System.out.println("True/false");
  
    default -&gt; System.out.println("Another");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <span class="text-viola">switch</span> no longer has a <span class="text-viola">break</span> statement. It was removed in Java 13 and replaced with <span class="text-user"><span class="text-bold">yield</span></span>.</p>

<h2>What is yield and where can it be used?</h2>

<p>When a <span class="text-viola">switch</span> consists of a single line, the <span class="text-viola">-&gt;</span> operator itself returns the value. But what if we have not one, but many lines of code? In such cases, the arrow operator won't return a value, since there are multiple lines, not one. </p>

<p>Maybe we can use <span class="text-viola">return</span>? After all, it is used to return values in Java. Alas, no, <span class="text-viola">return</span> won't work with a switch. So what can we use? There used to be <span class="text-viola">break</span>, but that was removed in Java 13. But in its place we now have <span class="text-user"><span class="text-bold">yield</span></span> — a new keyword that helps you return a value from a switch. It is analogous to <span class="text-viola">return</span> statements in methods.</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
var result = switch(condition) {
//…
case "Hi" -&gt; "greeting"
//…
};  
</code></pre>

<p>This code contains a single line, and the <span class="text-viola">-&gt;</span> operator will return "greeting".</p>

<p>But when we have a block of code:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
var result = switch(condition) {
//…
case "Hi" -&gt; {
// Your code
 Here you need to return "greeting"
	}
};  
</code></pre>

<p>The keyword that will help you return a value is <span class="text-user"><span class="text-bold">yield</span></span>:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
var result = switch(condition) {
//…
case "Hi" -&gt; {
// Your code
 yield "greeting";

	}
};
</code></pre>  

<p><span class="text-user"><span class="text-bold">yield</span></span> was added in Java 13 for cases where we have more than one line of code in a case block and we need to return a result.</p>

<p>You're probably eager to try out the new <span class="text-viola">switch</span> in your code, but remember that you need Java 14 or higher to do this. With earlier versions, this <span class="text-viola">switch</span> will only be available if you specify the "--enable-preview" flag on the command line, since before version 14 it was part of the technical preview, not a full-fledged part of the language.</p>

<p>That's all for now! See you!</p>
