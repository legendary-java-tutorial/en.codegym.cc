ExecutorService interface
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Prior to Java 5, you had to write all the code yourself in the application to manage threads. In addition, creating a new Thread object is a resource-intensive operation, and creating a new thread every time for “lightweight” tasks is irrational. And since this problem...
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<h2>Why do you need the Executor interface?</h2>

    <p>Prior to Java 5, you had to write all your own code thread management in your application. In addition, creating a <mark class="green">new Thread</mark> object is a resource-intensive operation, and it doesn't make sense to create a new thread for every lightweight task. And because this problem is familiar to absolutely every developer of multi-threaded applications, they decided to bring this functionality into Java as the <span class="text-bold">Executor</span> framework.</p>

    <p>What's the big idea? It's simple: instead of creating a new thread for each new task, threads are kept in a kind of "storage", and when a new task arrives, we retrieve an existing thread instead of creating a new one.</p>

    <p>The main interfaces of this framework are <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Executor</em></span></span>, <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> and <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ScheduledExecutorService</em></span></span>, each of which extends the functionality of the previous one.</p>

    <p>The Executor interface</em></span></span> is the base interface. It declares a single <span class="code text-orange">void execute(Runnable command)</span> method that is implemented by a <span class="text-orange">Runnable</span> object.</p>

    <p>The <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> interface is more interesting. It has methods for managing the completion of work, as well as methods for returning some kind of result. Let's take a closer look at its methods:</p>

    <p>Let's look at a small example of working with <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ExecutorServiceTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException {
//Create an ExecutorService for 2 threads
       java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService executorService = new ThreadPoolExecutor(2, 2, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(10));
// Create 5 tasks
       MyRunnable task1 = new MyRunnable();
       MyRunnable task2 = new MyRunnable();
       MyRunnable task3 = new MyRunnable();
       MyRunnable task4 = new MyRunnable();
       MyRunnable task5 = new MyRunnable();

       final List&lt;MyRunnable&gt; tasks = List.of(task1, task2, task3, task4, task5);
// Pass a list that contains the 5 tasks we created
       final List&lt;Future&lt;Void&gt;&gt; futures = executorService.invokeAll(tasks, 6, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
       System.out.println("Futures received");

// Stop the ExecutorService
       executorService.shutdown();

       try {
           TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }

       System.out.println(executorService.isShutdown());
       System.out.println(executorService.isTerminated());
   }

   public static class MyRunnable implements Callable&lt;Void&gt; {

       @Override
       public void call() {
// Add 2 delays. When the ExecutorService is stopped, we will see which delay is in progress when the attempt is made to stop execution of the task
           try {
               TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(3);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               System.out.println("sleep 1: " + e.getMessage());
           }
           try {
               TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               System.out.println("sleep 2: " + e.getMessage());
           }
           System.out.println("done");
           return null;
       }
   }
}
</code></pre>
 
    <p>Output:</p>

    <div class="terminal">done<br />
done<br />
Futures received<br />
sleep 1: sleep interrupted<br />
sleep 1: sleep interrupted<br />
done<br />
done<br />
true<br />
true</div>

<p>Each task runs for 5 seconds. We created a pool for two threads, so the first two lines of output make perfect sense.</p>

    <p>Six seconds after the program starts, the <span class="code text-orange">invokeAll</span> method times out and the result is returned as a list of <span class="text-red">Futures</span>. This can be seen from the output string <em><strong>Futures received</strong></em>.</p>

    <p>After the first two tasks are done, two more begin. But because the timeout set in the <span class="code text-orange">invokeAll</span> method elapses, these two tasks don't have time to complete. They receive a <em><strong>"cancel"</strong></em> command. That's why the output has two lines with <em><strong>sleep 1: sleep interrupted</strong></em>.</p>

    <p>And then you can see two more lines with <em><strong>done</strong></em>. This is the side effect that I mentioned when describing the <span class="code text-orange">invokeAll</span> method. </p>

    <p>The fifth and final task never even gets started, so we don't see anything about it in the output.</p>

    <p>The last two lines are the result of calling the <span class="code text-orange">isShutdown</span> and <span class="code text-orange">isTerminated</span> methods.</p>

    <p>It is also interesting to run this example in debug mode and look at the task status after the timeout elapses (set a breakpoint on the line with <em><strong>executorService.shutdown();</strong></em>):</p>

    <p>We see that two tasks <em><strong>Completed normally</strong></em>, and three tasks were <em><strong>"Cancelled"</strong></em>.</p>

    <h2>ScheduledExecutorService</h2>

    <p>To conclude our discussion of executors, let's take a look at <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ScheduledExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>

    <p>It has 4 methods:</p>
