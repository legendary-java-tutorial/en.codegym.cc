selector
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
In this lesson, we'll get to know the selector represented by the Selector class. The class is in the java.nio.channels package, so you don't need to download or configure anything to use it. An object of type Selector can follow one...
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>In this lesson, we'll get acquainted with the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">Selector</span></span> class. This class is in the <span class="text-bold">java.nio.channels</span> package, so you don't need to download or configure anything to use it. A <span class="text-orange">Selector</span> object can monitor one or more <span class="text-orange">Channel</span> objects, check their readiness to read/write, etc. And most importantly, a selector needs one stream, not one stream per channel.</p>
 
    

    <p>We create selectors using the static <span class="code text-orange">open</span> method:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
Selector selector = Selector.open();
</code></pre>

    <p>After that, channels can be registered in a selector object:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
SelectionKey key1 = channel1.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
SelectionKey key2 = channel2.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_WRITE);
</code></pre>

    <p>The second parameter of the <span class="code text-orange">register</span> method determines which operation the selector will monitor. If you need to monitor several operations at once, you can use bitwise OR: </p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
SelectionKey.OP_READ | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE
</code></pre>

    <p>When an I/O action occurs on any of the channels, the selector notifies us. This way you can, for example, read data from a large number of data sources.</p>

    <p>Here we need to mention that a channel must be in non-blocking mode in order for it to be used with a selector:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
channel1.configureBlocking(false);
channel2.configureBlocking(false);
SelectionKey key1 = channel1.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_READ);
SelectionKey key2 = channel2.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_WRITE);
</code></pre>

    <p>It follows that a selector will not work with a <span class="code"><span class="text-green">FileChannel</span></span>, because a <span class="code"><span class="text-green">FileChannel</span></span> cannot be switched to non-blocking mode (the <span class="code text-orange">configureBlocking</span> method is declared in the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">SelectableChannel</span></span> class, which <span class="code"><span class="text-green">FileChannel</span></span> does not inherit).</p>

    <p>From the diagram, you can see that selectors are suitable to use with sockets. We'll work with them at the end of the second module.</p>

    <h2>SelectionKey</h2>

    <p>When registering a channel with a selector, we get a <mark class="green">SelectionKey</mark> object. This object contains data about channel registration.</p>

    <p>You can use the key to determine if the channel is ready for a certain value:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
key.isReadable()
key.isAcceptable()
key.isConnectable()
key.isWritable()
</code></pre>

    <p>The key can give you the corresponding channel and selector:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
Channel channel = key.channel();
Selector selector = key.selector();
</code></pre>

    <p>You can attach any object to a key in order to track it in the future. This can be done either during channel registration (via the third argument) or later:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p><span class="code">SelectionKey key = channel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT, object);</p></li>
        <li><p><span class="code">key.attach(object);</span></p></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Later, you can get the attached object from the key:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
Object object = key.attachment();
</code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>After registering channels with a selector, we can:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>find out the number of channels ready to perform specified operations</li>
        <li>block execution of our program until at least one channel is ready</li>
        <li>get a set of keys for ready channels</li>
        <li>and more</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the end of the second module, we will try out selectors in practice.</p>
