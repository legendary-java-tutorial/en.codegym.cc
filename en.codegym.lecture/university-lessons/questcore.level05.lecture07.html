Class loading order, static data...
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
You already know that classes in Java are files on disk that contain bytecode, that is, compiled Java code. The Java machine does not load them unnecessarily. As soon as a class is called somewhere in the code, the Java machine checks to see if it is loaded. In this lecture, you'll learn what happens if it's not loaded... and much more.

<p>"Hello, Amigo! I heard Rishi explained something new and exciting to you?!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's right, Kim."</span></p>
<p>"My topic will be no less interesting. I want to tell you about how classes are loaded into memory."</p>
<p>Classes in Java are files on the disk that contain bytecode, which is compiled Java code.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, I remember."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-red">The Java machine doesn't load them if it doesn't need to.</span> As soon as there's a call to a class somewhere in the code, the Java machine checks to see if it is loaded. And if not, then it <span class="text-red">loads and initializes it.</span></p>
<p>Initializing a class involves assigning values to all of its static variables and calling all static initialization blocks.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That seems similar to calling a constructor on an object. But what's a static initialization block?"</span></p>
<p>"If you need to execute complex code (for example, loading something from a file) to initialize objects, we can do it in a constructor. However, static variables don't have this opportunity. But since the need still remains, you can add a static initialization block or blocks to classes. They are basically equivalent to static constructors."</p>
<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<p>It's a lot like what happens when a constructor is called. <span class="text-red">I've even written it as a (nonexistent) static constructor.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, I get it."</span></p>
<p>"Very good."</p>
