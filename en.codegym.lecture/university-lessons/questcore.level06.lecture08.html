Stop the Raging Stream: The Unofficial Version
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Let's say the user told the program to download a file from the Internet. The main thread created a separate child thread for this job, and passed it an object whose run method contains all the necessary actions to download the file. And then the user - time - and changed his mind to download this file! How to cancel the job and stop the thread?
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hello, Amigo! Here's an interesting question that you've either already had or you will soon. <strong><span class="text-red">How do you stop a running thread?</span></strong>"</p>
<p>Let's say the user tells the program to «download a file from the Internet». The main thread creates a separate child thread for this job, and passes it an object whose run method contains all the necessary actions to download the file.</p>
<p>But suddenly the user changes his mind. He doesn't want to download the file. <span class="text-red">How do we cancel a job and stop the thread?</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, tell me how?"</span></p>
<p>"<strong><span class="text-red">We can't. </span></strong>That's the most common and most correct answer. <span class="text-red">You cannot stop a thread. Only it can stop itself.</span>"</p>
<p>But you can send a signal to a thread, in some way telling it that the work no longer needs to be performed and that it should terminate. Just as the main thread terminates by returning from the main method, a child thread terminates by returning from the run method.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What's the best way to do that?"</span></p>
<p>"You can add some variable, such as a <strong>boolean</strong>. If it is <strong>true</strong>, the thread runs. If it is <strong>false</strong> , the thread should terminate. Like this, for example:"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"What if we have several threads, then what?"</span></p>
<p>"It's best to have such a variable for each thread. It's most convenient to add it directly to the class. You could add a <strong>boolean</strong> <strong>isRun</strong> variable there. However, it is better to add a boolean <strong>isCancel</strong> variable that becomes <strong>true</strong> if the task is canceled."</p>
