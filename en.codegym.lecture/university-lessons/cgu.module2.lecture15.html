<h2>Multithreading: methods of the Thread class</h2>

    <p><a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/1993" target="_blank">In this lesson</a>, we'll continue to talk about multithreading. We'll explore the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">Thread</span></span> class and how several of its methods work. </p>
