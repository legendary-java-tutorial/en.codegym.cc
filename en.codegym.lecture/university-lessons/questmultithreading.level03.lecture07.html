Inner anonymous classes, examples

Hello Amigo! - So hello already, Ellie! So, don't argue with your aunt. In the 31st century, it is customary to say hello again if you have not seen a person for more than half an hour.

<p>"Hi, Amigo!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But we've already said hello, Ellie!"</span></p>
<p>"Hey, don't argue with your aunt. In the 31st century, if you haven't seen someone for more than half an hour, it's customary to say hello again. So don't give me your attitude!"</p>
<p>"Anyway, it's time for another interesting topic: robot reproduction!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"O_O."</span></p>
<p>"Just kidding, the new topic is <strong>anonymous inner classes</strong>."</p>
<p>"In Java, sometimes there are situations where you'll need a class to inherit several classes. Since Java doesn't support multiple inheritance, they've solved this problem using inner classes: in our class, we declare an inner class and make it inherit whatever class we need it to inherit. Here's an example:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Example of an inner class that inherits the Thread class</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class <span class="text-green">Tiger</span> extends Cat
{
 public void <span class="text-green">tigerRun</span>()
 {
  .....
 }

 public void <span class="text-green">startTiger</span>()
 {
  <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span> <span class="text-user">thread</span> = new <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span>();
  <span class="text-user">thread</span>.start();
 }

 class <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span> extends Thread
 {
  public void run()
  {
   <span class="text-green">tigerRun</span>();
  }
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>"Let's dig into another example:"</p>
<p>We need a subclass of the Thread class in order to override its run method."</p>
<p>"That's why in the Tiger class we declared the <strong>TigerThread</strong> inner class, which inherits Thread and overrides the run method.</p>
<p>"For convenience, we defined two methods in the Tiger class: <strong>tigerRun and startTiger</strong> (which are analogous to Thread's run and start methods."</p>
<p>"In the tigerStart method, we create a <strong>TigerThread</strong> object and invoke its start() method."</p>
<p>"The JVM will create a new thread that will start running when <strong>TigerThread's</strong> run method is called."</p>
<p>"This method then calls our <strong>run</strong> method: <strong>tigerRun</strong>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I've worked with threads before, so this seems straightforward."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Do we have to name the methods tigerRun and tigerStart?"</span></p>
<p>"No, we could have called them run and start, but I also wanted to demonstrate that we are not inheriting Thread. An explanation might have been more confusing."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"OK. Then I think I get it. But if tigerStart is called a second time, we'll create and start a second Thread object. Doesn't that mean that we'll have «one tiger running on two different threads»?"</span></p>
<p>"Well, aren't you sharp! You're right, and that's not good. Let's rewrite the code like this:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Code</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class <span class="text-green">Tiger</span> extends Cat
{
 public void <span class="text-green">tigerRun</span>()
 {
  .....
 }

 public void <span class="text-green">startTiger</span>()
 {
  thread.start();
 }

 private <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span> <span class="text-user">thread</span> = new <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span>();

 private class <span class="text-viola">TigerThread</span> extends Thread
 {
  public void run()
  {
   <span class="text-green">tigerRun</span>();
  }
 }
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"It's not quite perfect. You still can't call a method like that twice. But this time, at least we won't create a second thread and make it seem like everything is fine."</span></p>
<p>"That's right. The second time a Tiger is started, you'll get an exception."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm already spotting mistakes better than you, Ellie!"</span></p>
<p>"Yeah, you're doing great. Then let's move on to anonymous inner classes."</p>
<p>"Note several aspects of the code above:"</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> We inherited the Thread class, but implemented practically no code there. "It was more «we had to inherit the Thread class» rather than «we inherited it to extend it».</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Only one TigerThread object will be created.</p>
<p>In other words, we wrote a whole bunch of code just to override one method and create one object.</p>
<p>Do you remember how I talked about the invention of constructors?</p>

<p>"We can combine four things into one:"</p>

<p>2) method overriding</p>
<p>3) declaration of a variable</p>
<p>4) creation of an instance of a derived class.</p>
