<h2>1. Installing the plugin</h2>
<p>To make your life much easier, CodeGym created a special plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that lets you get tasks and submit them for verification in a couple of clicks. It's super convenient — you'll see for yourself right now.</p>
<p>For now, the CodeGym plugin isn't included in the standard set of plugins in the IntelliJ IDEA repository, so you will have to download it from our website and install it manually in IDEA. This is pretty simple to do.</p>
<p>Before installing it, you need to "<a href="https://codegym.cc/downloads/ide/plugin.jar?isNew=true">Download the plugin</a>".</p>
