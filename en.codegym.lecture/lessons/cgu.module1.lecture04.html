<h2>WebIDE</h2>
<p>To make it easier for you to solve tasks, we've written a special widget: <span class="term">WebIDE</span>. It looks approximately like this:</p>
<img data-id="3d12cf31-f908-474d-a64f-fd652c2b6d1d" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/3d12cf31-f908-474d-a64f-fd652c2b6d1d/original.png" alt="WebIDE">
<p>On the left, you see the <span class="text-green">task conditions and requirements</span> that your solution must satisfy. In the center, we have the <span class="text-user">editor, which is where you need to write your code</span>. Your program displayed some text, which you can see in the pane at the bottom.</p>
<p>And at the top you will see these buttons:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Verify</strong>: Submit your solution for testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Help</strong>: A drop-down list that contains:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hint</strong>: Display a hint for solving the current task.</li>
            <li><strong>Community help</strong>: Ask the CodeGym community a question about your solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Correct solution</strong>: Show the author's solution to the task.</li>
            <li><strong>Restore my code</strong>: Revert to your code after seeing the correct solution.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear solution</strong>: Reset your solution, i.e. start over.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Discuss</strong>: Discuss the task with other users.</li>
    <li><strong>Run</strong>: Start the program without submitting it for verification (your verification counter won't increase).</li>
    <li><strong>Code analysis</strong>: Get suggestions on your solution's code style.</li>
</ul>
