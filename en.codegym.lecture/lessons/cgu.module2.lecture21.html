<h2>Why might you need an ExecutorService for 1 thread?</h2>

    <p>You can use the <span class="code text-orange">Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor</span> method to create an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> with a pool that includes a single thread. The pool's logic is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The service executes only one task at a time. </li>
        <li>If we submit N tasks for execution, all N tasks will be executed one after another by the single thread.</li>
        <li>If the thread is interrupted, a new thread will be created to execute any remaining tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's imagine a situation where our program requires the following functionality: </p>

    <p>We need to process user requests within 30 seconds, but no more than one request per unit of time. </p>

    <p>We create a task class for processing a user request: </p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
class Task implements Runnable {
   private final int taskNumber;

   public Task(int taskNumber) {
       this.taskNumber = taskNumber;
   }

   @Override
   public void run() {
       try {
           Thread.sleep(1000);
       } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
       }
       System.out.printf("Processed request #%d on thread id=%d\\n", taskNumber, Thread.currentThread().getId());
   }
}
    </code></pre>

    <p>The class models the behavior of processing an incoming request and displays its number. </p>
 
    <p>Next, in the <span class="code text-orange">main</span> method, we create an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> for 1 thread, which we will use to sequentially process incoming requests. Since the task conditions stipulate "within 30 seconds", we add 30-second wait and then forcibly stop the <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
   ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

   for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1_000; i++) {
       executorService.execute(new Task(i));
   }
   executorService.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
   executorService.shutdownNow();
}
    </code></pre>
 
    <p>After starting the program, the console displays messages about request processing:</p> 
 
    <div class="terminal">Processed request #0 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #1 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #2 on thread id=16<br />
…<br />
Processed request #29 on thread id=16</div>
 
    <p>After processing requests for 30 seconds, <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executorService</em></span></span> calls the <span class="code text-orange">shutdownNow()</span> method, which stops the current task (the one being executed) and cancels all pending tasks. After that, the program ends successfully.</p>
 
    <p>But everything is not always so perfect, because our program could easily have a situation where one of the tasks picked up by our pool's only thread works incorrectly and even terminates our thread. We can simulate this situation to figure out how <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executorService</em></span></span> works with a single thread in this case. </p>
 
    <p>To do this, while one of the tasks is being executed, we terminate our thread using the unsafe and obsolete <span class="code text-orange">Thread.currentThread().stop()</span> method. We're doing this intentionally to simulate the situation where one of the tasks terminates the thread. <p>
 
    <p>We'll change the <span class="code text-orange">run</span> method in the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">Task</span></span> class: </p>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
@Override
public void run() {
   try {
       Thread.sleep(1000);
   } catch (InterruptedException ignored) {
   }

   if (taskNumber == 5) {
       Thread.currentThread().stop();
   }

   System.out.printf("Processed request #%d on thread id=%d\\n", taskNumber, Thread.currentThread().getId());
}
    </code></pre>
 
    <p>We'll interrupt task #5.</p>

    <p>Let's see what the output looks like with the thread interrupted at the end of task #5:</p> 
 
    <div class="terminal">Processed request #0 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #1 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #2 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #3 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #4 on thread id=16<br />
Processed request #6 on thread id=17<br />
Processed request #7 on thread id=17<br />
…<br />
Processed request #29 on thread id=17</div>
 
    <p>We see that after the thread is interrupted at the end of task 5, the tasks begin to be executed in a thread whose identifier is 17, although they had previously been executed on the thread with whose identifier is 16. And because our pool has a single thread, this can only mean one thing: <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>executorService</em></span></span> replaced the stopped thread with a new one and continued to execute the tasks. </p>
 
    <p>Thus, we should use <span class="code text-orange">newSingleThreadExecutor</span> with a single-thread pool when we want to process tasks sequentially and only one at a time, and we want to continue processing tasks from the queue regardless of the completion of the previous task (e.g. the case where one of our tasks kills the thread).</p>
 
    <h2>ThreadFactory</h2>
 
    <p>When speaking of creating and recreating threads, we can't help but mention <mark class="green">ThreadFactory</mark>. </p>
 
    <p>A <mark class="green">ThreadFactory</mark> is an object that creates new threads on demand.</p>
 
    <p>We can create our own thread creation factory and pass an instance of it to the <span class="code text-orange">Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(ThreadFactory threadFactory)</span> method.</p>
 
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(new ThreadFactory() {
            @Override
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                return new Thread(r, "MyThread");
            }
        });
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>We override the method for creating a new thread, passing a thread name to the constructor.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(new ThreadFactory() {
            @Override
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                Thread thread = new Thread(r, "MyThread");
                thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
                return thread;
            }
        });
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>We changed the name and priority of the created thread.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
 
    <p>So we see that we have 2 overloaded <span class="code text-orange">Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor</span> methods. One without parameters, and a second with a <span class="text-orange">ThreadFactory</span> parameter. </p>

    <p>Using a <span class="text-orange">ThreadFactory</span>, you can configure the created threads as needed, for example, by setting priorities, using thread subclasses, adding an <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold">UncaughtExceptionHandler</span></span> to the thread, and so on.</p>
