<p>"So, topic number two is static nested classes. Remember that non-static nested classes are called <strong>inner classes</strong>.</p>
<p>"Let's wrap our heads around what the word static means in the context of a nested class declaration. What do you think?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"If a variable is declared as static, then only one copy of the variable exists. So, if a nested class is static, then does that mean you can only create one object of that class?"</span></p>
<p>"Don't let the word <strong>static</strong> confuse you here. It is true that if a variable is declared as static, then there is only one copy of the variable. But a static nested class is more like a static method in this regard. The word static before the class declaration indicates that the class does not store references to objects of its outer class."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Ah. Normal methods implicitly store a object reference, but static methods do not. It's the same with static classes, am I right, Ellie?"</span></p>
<p>"Absolutely. Your quick understanding is commendable. Static nested classes don't have hidden references to objects of their outer class."</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class Zoo
{
 private static int count = 7;
 private int mouseCount = 1;

 public static int getAnimalCount()
 {
  return count;
 }

 public int getMouseCount()
 {
  return mouseCount;
 }

 <span class="text-green">public static class Mouse
 {
  public Mouse()
  {
  }
   public int getTotalCount()
  {
   return count + mouseCount; // Compilation error.
  }
 }</span>
}</code></pre>
<p>"Let's review this example carefully."</p>
<p><strong>"What variables can the static getAnimalCount method access?"</strong></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Only the static ones. Because it is a static method."</span></p>
<p><strong>"What variables can the getMouseCount method access?"</strong></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Both the static and non-static ones. It has a hidden reference (this) to a Zoo object."</span></p>
<p>"That's right. So, the static nested Mouse class, like a static method, can access the Zoo class's static variables, but it can't access non-static ones."</p>
<p>"We can safely create Mouse objects, even if not a single Zoo object has been created. Here's how you can do that:"</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class Home
{
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
  Zoo.Mouse mouse = new Zoo.Mouse();
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>"The Mouse class is actually a very ordinary class. The fact that it is declared inside the Zoo class gives it two special features."</p>
<p>1) When creating objects of a nested class (such as the Mouse class) outside the outer class, you must also use the dot operator to specify the name of the outer class.</p>
<p>"Like this, for example: Zoo.Mouse."</p>
<p>2) The Zoo.Mouse class and its objects have access to the Zoo class's private static variables and methods (since the Mouse class is also declared inside the Zoo class).</p>
<p>"Thatâ€™s it for today."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So just an additional name and that's it?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's even easier than it seemed at first."</span></p>
