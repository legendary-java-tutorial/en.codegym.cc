<h2>1.1 History of HTML</h2>
<p>Nowadays almost all people use the Internet. Read articles, use a browser, follow links. And only a few of them are
    wondering <strong>when and by whom was the Internet invented?</strong></p>
<p>It still depends on what you call the Internet. Most often, the layman means one thing, and the technician means
    another. The computer network connecting the world's largest data centers was created back in the 70s. But the
    Internet accessible to an ordinary person (browser, links, all sorts of pages) <strong>was invented by one person in
        the early 90s</strong> . And it was like this...</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, Briton <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> invented the Internet. Although, nevertheless, what he
    invented is more correctly called the Web:, <code>World Wide Web</code>he is <code>www</code>, he is also the World
    Wide Web. Yes, one man invented the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>From 1986-1991 he worked at the CERN Research Center (in Geneva, Switzerland) on a new scientific documentation
    standard. You see, it is customary for scientists to publish scientific papers in the form of articles, and at the
    end of the articles to indicate the list of used literature. In other words, scientific knowledge is a list of
    articles with links to each other.</p>
<p>By the way, <span
        class="text-green">modern Wikipedia very much resembles how its creator saw the World Wide Web</span> :
    scientific articles with links to each other, a list of sources and literature used. And if Tim was lucky, then the
    web would still be like this. But on the way to a brighter future, the world took a wrong turn somewhere :)</p>
<p>The web is based on three technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>HTML-page</code>, which contains text, pictures, and links to other<code>HTML-pages.</code></li>
    <li>• A browser that displays <code>HTML-page</code>in the most human-friendly way.</li>
    <li>• Protocol <code>http</code>- a standard for web servers to communicate with browsers and each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee didn't so much invent these things as he standardized them. <code>HTML</code>- was created on the
    basis of the standard <code>SGML</code>. Tags were also borrowed from there. But the world's first web browser
    called <code>WorldWideWeb</code>Tim wrote himself, and back in 1990.</p>
<h2>1.2 HTML is not a programming language</h2>
<p><code>HTML</code>it is not a programming language and never has been. Never say that. Even if you will write a
    resume, never indicate <code>HTML</code>in the programming languages ​​section, only in the Tools (technology)
    section. It would be a gross mistake to write in your resume that you know a programming language <code>HTML</code>.
    Why?</p>
<p>And the thing is that <code>HTML</code>it is a markup language for documents. If we simplify it very much, then
    <code>HTML-document</code>it is a text (document) with pictures, tables, links, etc. inserted into it.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to write an article that will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Title of the article (title).</li>
    <li>The article itself, consisting of one paragraph.</li>
    <li>Picture.</li>
    <li>A few important statements you want to put in bold.</li>
    <li>In the middle of the article, provide a link to some useful information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how this document will look in the browser:</p>
<hr>
<h3>domestic cat</h3>
<p>From the point of view of scientific taxonomy, the domestic cat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"
                                                                         target="_blank">a mammal of the</a> cat family
    of the carnivora order. Often, a domestic cat is considered as a subspecies of the forest cat, however, from the
    point of view of modern biological taxonomy (2017), the domestic cat <strong>is a separate biological
        species</strong> .</p><img data-max-width="800" data-id="f1c46123-2629-47c7-9aff-878dc13cce61" alt=""

<hr>
<p>Pretty good, right? And the standard <code>HTML</code>allows you to make this document readable for both humans and
    computers. Here's what it looks like in <code>HTML-standard</code>:</p>
<p><span class="text-red">&lt;h1&gt;</span> Domestic cat <span class="text-red">&lt;/h1&gt;</span></p>
<p>From the point of view of scientific taxonomy, the domestic cat is <span class="text-red">&lt;a href=”/”&gt;</span> a
    mammal <span class="text-red">&lt;/a&gt;</span> of the cat family of the carnivora order. Often, a domestic cat is
    considered as a subspecies of the forest cat, however, from the point of view of modern biological taxonomy (2017),
    the domestic cat <span class="text-red">&lt;b&gt;</span> is a separate biological species <span class="text-red">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
    .</p>
<p><span class="text-red">&lt;img src=”cat.jpg”&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong>Special tags</strong> were added to the text of the article (highlighted <span class="text-red">in red</span>
    ), which are understood by both a person and a computer (browser). The browser can display the article beautifully
    for the reader, and the author of the article can easily edit it.</p>
<h2>1.3 The emergence of the HTTP protocol</h2>
<p>The abbreviation <code>HTML</code>stands for <code>Hyper Text Markup Language</code>Hypertext Document Markup
    Language. Hypertext is a document consisting of pages that link to each other. What is it <code>http</code>?</p>
<p><code>HTTP</code>stands for <code>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</code>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (standard). <code>http</code>or
    <code>https</code>you can see in the address bar of the browser if you try to copy the link to the open page.</p>
<p>A typical page link looks like this:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present  language-java" tabindex="0"><code class=" language-java"><span
            class="text-red">http</span><span class="token operator">:</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span
            class="token operator">/</span><span class="text-green">google<span
            class="token punctuation">.</span>com</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span class="text-user">logo<span
            class="token punctuation">.</span>jpg</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>At the very beginning of the link is the name of the protocol, followed by a colon and two forward slashes. <strong>Tim
    Bernes-Lee once said in one of his interviews that if he knew that the protocol <code>http</code>would be so
    popular, he would have come up with something shorter. </strong>(after all, almost all links in the world begin with
    the word <code>http://</code>or <code>https://</code>)</p>
<p>Let's get back to browsers. When a browser requests <code>html-page</code>, it sends a text file (request) to the
    server and receives another text file (response) in return. This mode of operation is called client-server.</p>
<p>First, there are lines with key information, then with service information. The first line of the text query is given
    by the template:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present  language-java" tabindex="0"><code class=" language-java"><span
            class="text-orange">Method</span><span class="text-user">URI  </span>HTTP<span
            class="token operator">/</span><span class="text-orange">Version</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>CodeGym user's personal page is given by the link</p>
<pre class=" line-numbers language-java" tabindex="0"><span aria-hidden="true"
                                                            class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span><code
        class=" language-java">https<span class="token operator">:</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span
        class="token operator">/</span><span class="text-green">codegym<span class="token punctuation">.</span>cc<span
        class="token operator">/</span></span><span class="token operator"></span><span
        class="text-user">me</span></code></pre>
<p><code>http-request</code>browser for it looks like this:</p>
<pre class=" line-numbers language-java" tabindex="0"><span aria-hidden="true"
                                                            class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span><code
        class=" language-java">GET <span class="token operator"></span><span class="text-user"><span
        class="token operator">/</span>me  </span><span class="text-viola">HTTP<span
        class="token operator">/</span><span class="token number">1.0</span> </span>
<span class="token class-name">Host</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="text-green">codegym<span
            class="token punctuation">.</span>cc</span></code></pre>
<p>As a response, the server will most likely send</p>
<pre class=" line-numbers language-java" tabindex="0"><span aria-hidden="true"
                                                            class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span><code
        class=" language-java"><span class="text-viola">HTTP<span class="token operator">/</span><span
        class="token number">1.0</span> </span><span class="token number">200</span> OK
<span class="token generics"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>html<span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>page text...</code></pre>
<p>The first line in the response text is <span class="text-green">the http protocol version and the response status (200, OK)</span>
    . <span class="text-user">Then comes an empty line</span> and then just in text form comes the one
    <code>html-page</code>that the browser requested. Everything is very simple :)</p>
