<p>"Hello, Amigo! I'm going to tell you about <span class="text-red">method overloading</span>."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"You can overload them too?! What a day!"</span></p>
<p>"You can do a lot with them, but we won't go into that right now."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"It's a deal."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-green">"Overloading is a very simple operation.</span> Actually, it's not even an operation on methods, though it is sometimes referred to by a frightening name: <strong>parametric polymorphism</strong>."</p>
<p>The thing you must remember is that every method in a class must have a unique name.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yeah, I know."</span></p>
<p>"Well, that's not entirely true. I mean, it's not at all true. A method does not have to have a unique name. What must be unique is <span class="text-green">the combination of a method name and the types of its parameters</span>. This combination is also known as a method signature."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"I've already seen that somewhere."</span></p>
<p>"Yep. When you type "<strong>System.out.println</strong>", IntelliJ IDEA suggests a couple dozen versions of <strong>print</strong> methods that use different parameters. The compiler simply identifies and then calls the required method based on the types of the parameters you pass."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's not so difficult. But it's not polymorphism."</span></p>
<p>"Or more accurately, it's not method overriding."</p>
<p>By the way, I want to point out that <span class="text-corporate">the parameter names are irrelevant.</span> They are lost during compilation. Once a method is compiled, <span class="text-green">only its name and parameter types are known.</span></p>
