s project complements the Java Collections platform. It provides several classes that make handling collections much easier. It also provides many new interfaces, implementations, and utilities.</p>
<p>The main features of the Commons project collections are as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Bag <br>
   interfaces simplify collections that have multiple copies of each object.</li>
 <li>BidiMap The <br>
   BidiMap interfaces provide bidirectional maps that can be used to look up values ​​using keys or keys using values.</li>
 <li>MapIterator The <br>
   MapIterator interface provides simple iteration over maps.</li>
 <li>Transformation Decorators <br>
   Transformation decorators can change each object in the collection as and when it is added to the collection.</li>
 <li>Compound Collections <br>
   Compound collections are used when multiple collections must be treated in the same way.</li>
 <li>Ordered map <br>
   Ordered maps maintain the order in which elements are added.</li>
 <li>Ordered set <br>
   Ordered sets store the order in which elements are added.</li>
 <li>Reference Map <br>
   The Reference Map allows you to collect keys/values ​​under strict control.</li>
 <li>Comparator Implementations <br>
   There are many comparator implementations available.</li>
 <li>Iterator Implementations <br>
   There are many iterator implementations available.</li>
 <li>Adapter Classes <br>
   Adapter classes are available for converting arrays and enums into collections.</li>
 <li>Utilities Utilities <br>
   are available for testing or creating typical properties of set theories, such as union, intersection. Supports closing.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of information, so just try to remember that there are such collections.</p>
<p>And remember one thing! If you want to implement something of your own, unique, first check if there is already a ready-made solution for this. Most likely it will, because you are not the first to learn Java. If you use some ready-made solution, it will be easier for you and your colleagues)</p>
