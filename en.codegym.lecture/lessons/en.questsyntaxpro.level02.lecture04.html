<h2>1. How memory is organized</h2>
<p>Every computer has <span class="term text-viola">internal memory</span>. What is it? What properties does it have? And, most importantly, how does it benefit us?</p>
<p>Every program (including <span class="term text-neon">programs</span> written in Java) is loaded into <span class="term text-viola">main memory</span> before being executed.&nbsp;Main memory contains the program code (which is executed by the processor) as well as the program data (i.e. data that the program itself puts into memory).</p>
<p>What is memory and what is it like?</p>
<p>An Ex—Åel spreadsheet consists of <span class="term text-green">cells</span>. Each cell has its own <span class="term text-brown">unique identifier</span> (<code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, ... <code>B1</code>, <code>B2</code>). If you know a <span class="term text-brown">cell's identifier</span>, then you can always write some value into it or get whatever value is stored there. Computer <span class="term text-viola">memory</span> is organized in a very similar way.</p>
<img data-max-width="1024" data-id="8183ec24-b4fc-4ae4-bde4-0d53f2d43699" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/8183ec24-b4fc-4ae4-bde4-0d53f2d43699/1024.jpeg" alt="">
</p>
<p>The program and program data are stored in <span class="term text-viola">memory</span> when the program is running.&nbsp;All computer memory is comprised of small cells called <span class="term text-green">bytes</span>. Each cell has a unique identifier, or number, associated with it: <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, ...; (the numbering starts from zero). If we know a <span class="term text-brown">cell's number</span>, we can save data in it. Or get data from it.&nbsp;Some cells store the program's code, i.e. the set of commands for the processor. Others store the data used by the program. The cell's number is also called the <span class="term text-brown">cell address</span>.</span></p>
<p>The processor knows how to execute commands that have been loaded into memory. Almost all processor commands are something like <span class="term">take data from some cells</span>, <span class="term">do something with them</span>, then <span class="term">send the result to other cells</span>.</p>
<p>We combine hundreds of simple commands to get complex and useful commands.</p>
<p>When a variable is declared in code, a chunk of <span class="term text-viola">memory</span> that isn't already being used is allocated for it. This is usually a few bytes. Declaring a variable requires that you indicate the type of information the program will store in it: numbers, text, or other data. After all, if you don't know the type of information to be stored, then it isn't clear how large of a block of memory needs to be allocated for the variable.</p>
<p>At the dawn of the computer age, programs worked directly with memory addresses, but then, for programmers' convenience, the cells began to be given names. A <span class="term text-red">unique</span> variable name is above all for the convenience of programmers, since the program handles plain memory addresses just fine.</p>

<h2>2. Variables in memory</h2>
<p>In all, Java has 4 data types for storing integers. These are <code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>.</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th class="text-center">Type</th>
        <th class="text-center">Size in bytes</th>
        <th>Origin of the type's name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>byte</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>1</code></td>
        <td><span class="term">byte</span> is a deliberate respelling of bite to avoid confusion with bit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>short</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>2</code></td>
        <td>Short for <span class="term">Short Integer</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>int</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>4</code></td>
        <td>Short for <span class="term">Integer</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>long</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>8</code></td>
        <td>Short for <span class="term">Long Integer</span></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Additionally, Java has 2 types for real numbers: float and double:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th class="text-center">Type</th>
        <th class="text-center">Size in bytes</th>
        <th>Origin of the type's name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>float</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>4</code></td>
        <td>Short for <span class="term">Floating Point Number</span></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="text-center"><code>double</code></td>
        <td class="text-center"><code>8</code></td>
        <td>Short for <span class="term">Double Float</span></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Each time program execution reaches a command to create a variable, a small block of memory is allocated for it (the size depends on the type of the variable).</p>
<div class="lesson-note lesson-note--important">
    <div class="lesson-note__container">
        <div class="lesson-note__content">
            <div class="text-center">
                The address of a variable is the address of the first cell of the allocated memory&nbsp;block.

        </div>

<p>Java programs are not allowed to access memory directly. Any and all work with memory happens only through the Java virtual machine.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. The <code>String</code> type in memory</h2>
<p>The <code class="text-orange">String</code> type can store large amounts of data, which implies that it is not just a data type, but a full-fledged class.</p>
<p>The <code class="text-orange">String</code> object is placed in an allocated block of memory that stores the address of another block of memory in which the text is stored.</p>
<p><img data-max-width="1024" data-id="1f1fc1df-e40f-432f-b83a-fa13820862a1" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/1f1fc1df-e40f-432f-b83a-fa13820862a1/1024.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <code>int</code> <code class="text-green">a</code> variable occupies <code>4</code> bytes and stores the value <code class="text-green">1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>int</code> <code class="text-green">b</code> variable occupies <code>4</code> bytes and stores the value <code class="text-green">10,555</code>. We use a comma as the thousands separator. And we use a period as the decimal separator.</p>
<p>The <code>double</code> <code class="text-user">d</code> variable occupies <code>8</code> bytes and stores the value <code class="text-user">13.001</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>String</code> <code class="text-orange">str</code> variable occupies <code>4</code> bytes and stores the value <code><span class="text-red">G13</span></code>, which is the address of the first cell of the memory block containing the text.</p>
<p>A text of the <code>String</code> <code>object</code> is stored in a separate block of memory. The address of its first cell is stored in the <code class="text-orange">str</code> variable.</p>

<h2>4. Why numbering starts with zero in programming</h2>
<p>People often wonder why programmers almost always start counting from zero. Well, the fact is that there are many situations when <span class="term text-green">it is more convenient to count from zero</span> (of course, there are also situations when it is more convenient to count from <code>1</code>).</p>
<p>The simplest example of is memory addressing. If your variable has been allocated <code>4</code> bytes of memory and you know that <code>X</code> is the address of the first byte, then what are the addresses of each byte? <code>X<span class="text-red">+</span>0</code>, <code>X<span class="text-red">+</span>1</code>, <code>X<span class="text-red">+</span>2</code>, <code>X<span class="text-red">+</span>3</code>. As simple as that, we have a group of bytes that can be accessed with indices <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>When we think of a relative address within a data block, indexing from zero is what makes sense. This is the main reason for <span class="term text-green">counting from zero</span>.</p>
