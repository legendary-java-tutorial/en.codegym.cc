<p>"Hello, Amigo! We have a fascinating new topic."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Today is just a day of fascinating topics!"</span></p>
<p>"Why, thank you!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"You're welcome."</span></p>
<p>"Remember when <span class="text-corporate">we introduced the ChessItem base class to simplify all the classes for chess pieces?"</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes."</span></p>
<p>"Now imagine that each piece has a method that handles rendering the piece on the screen. You call the method and the piece draws itself at its current coordinates. Would it be helpful to move this method into the base class?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes." After I've learned about polymorphism, I would be able to call the render method for all of the pieces, regardless of their type. Something like this:"</span></p>
<div class="code-heading">For example:</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>class ChessBoard
{
  public void drawAllChessItems()
  {
  //draw them regardless of their type.
  ArrayList &lt;<span class="text-corporate">ChessItem</span>&gt; <mark>items</mark> = new ArrayList&lt;<span class="text-corporate">ChessItem</span>&gt;();
  <mark>items</mark>.add(new King());
  <mark>items</mark>.add(new Queen());
  <mark>items</mark>.add(new Bishop());

  //draw them regardless of their type.
  for (<span class="text-corporate">ChessItem</span> item: <mark>items</mark>)
  {
   item.draw();
  }
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>"Well done. Exactly. And what would be done by the draw method of the ChessItem class itself?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I don't know. Chess doesn't have such a piece. And that means it has no visual representation."</span></p>
<p>"Precisely. And it doesn't make sense to create a ChessItem object. There is no such chess piece. <span class="text-red">It's only <em>an abstraction</em>â€”a class that we made for convenience.</span> That's how abstraction works in OOP: we moved all the important (shared by all pieces) data and methods into a <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/12-base-class-constructors--' target='_blank'>base class</a>, but we kept their differences in the classes corresponding to specific chess pieces."</p>

<p>Java has a special class type for this: <strong>the abstract class</strong>. Here are three things to remember about abstract classes.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> <span class="text-green">An abstract class can declare methods without implementing them.</span> Such a method is called an abstract method.</p>
<div class="code-heading">For example:</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code> public <span class="text-red">abstract</span> class ChessItem
{
 public int x, y; //coordinates
 private int value; //the piece's "value"

 public int getValue() //an ordinary method, returns value
 {
   return value;
 }

 <span class="text-red">public abstract void draw();</span> //abstract method. There is no implementation.

}</code></pre>
<div class="task-widget-container" showCover="true" taskKey="com.codegym.task.task12.task1234"></div>
<p><strong>2)</strong> <span class="text-green">An abstract method is marked with the keyword <strong>abstract</strong>.</span></p>
<p>If a class has even one abstract method, then the class is also marked with <span class="text-red"><strong>abstract</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> <span class="text-red">You cannot create objects of an abstract class.</span> Code attempting to do so simply won't compile.</p>

    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java block-inline" data-line="" data-start=""><code>ChessItem item = <span class="text-red">new ChessItem</span>();
item.draw();</code></pre>

    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java block-inline" data-line="" data-start=""><code>ChessItem item = <span class="text-green">new Queen</span>();
item.draw();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td><span class="text-green">But you can do this.</span></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>4)</strong> If your class inherits an abstract class, you need to override all of the inherited abstract methods, i.e. you have to implement them. Otherwise, your class will also have to be declared abstract. <span class="text-red">If the class has even one unimplemented method declared directly in the class or inherited from the parent class, then the class is considered abstract.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But why is all this necessary? Why do we need abstract classes? Isn't it possible to use ordinary classes instead? And instead of abstract methods, can't we just create empty implementations consisting of opening and closing curly brackets?"</span></p>
<p>"You could. But these restrictions are like the <code>private</code> modifier. We use the <code>private</code> modifier to deliberately block direct access to data, so that other programmers and their classes use our <code>public</code> methods."</p>
<p>The same applies to an abstract class. <span class="text-green">Whoever wrote the class doesn't want anyone to create instances of the class.</span> On the contrary, the author expects the abstract methods of his or her abstract class to be inherited and overridden.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I still don't understand why we would want to complicate our lives this way."</span></p>
<p>"The advantage of this feature is evident in large projects. The more classes you have, the more clearly you need to delineate their roles. You'll see the advantage of doing this, and soon. Everybody has to go through this."</p>
