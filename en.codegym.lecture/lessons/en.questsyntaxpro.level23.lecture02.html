<p>Another level is behind you! In the previous lessons, you learned about the if-else conditional statement and the nuances associated with it. We got acquainted with a special data type: boolean. We examined examples of using comparison operators and boolean variables. Finally, we learned more about comparing references and strings.</p>
<p>If you feel that a little more theory and some visual examples definitely won't hurt you, then carry on: here are links to a couple of useful articles.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/equals-and-string-comparsions" target="_blank">Equals and comparing strings</a></h2>
<p>Comparing objects is different from comparing primitive data types. You probably already guessed why this is so. In the case of objects, we pass a reference, but in the case of primitives, a value... There are many more interesting nuances that you will learn about from this article. As usual, we will explore the topic using lively examples.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/14-ternary-operator" target="_blank">Ternary operator</a></h2>
<p>To beginners, this is very unusual beast. By and large, you can entirely do without it... but the ternary operator shortens the code so easily and beautifully! And this is exactly what a beginner programmer should strive for. If you have not yet had time to thoroughly familiarize yourself with this replacement for the if-else construct, then we recommend that you get to know it better and slowly weave it into your code.</p>
