<p>Programs very often include a requirement to quickly write data to a file or elsewhere. And this raises questions: How should we do this? Which class should we choose? Today we'll get to know a suitable candidate for this role — the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">BufferedWriter</span></span> class.</p>

<h2>Why do we need BufferedWriter?</h2>

<p>BufferedWriter</span></span> is a class that writes buffered characters to a stream. It lets you reduce the number of times you access physical media. That is, instead of writing a single character each time, it writes data to a buffer, and then writes all the characters to the medium all at once. </p>

<p>This greatly increases write speeds. The default buffer size is 8192 characters, but this can be changed by specifying a new size in the constructor:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
BufferedWriter(Writer in, int sz)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the constructor's first argument is a stream that will receive the data we write. And it turns out that <span class="code">sz</span> is the size of the new buffer.</p>

<p>Java also has a <span class="code"><span class="text-green">BufferedReader</span></span> class: it is used for buffered reading of data. </p>

<p>What exactly is a buffer? Let's take a real life example. A buffer is like a basket or shopping cart at a supermarket. Instead of walking up to the checkout with a single item, paying for it, putting it in the trunk of your car, and then coming back for another item, we can take a shopping cart, put everything we want in it, and then pay at the checkout. This is exactly how a buffer works: it collect data and then takes everything and writes it, instead of writing each fragment separately.</p>

<h2>Constructors and methods of the BufferedWriter class</h2>

<p>Now let's take a closer look at the <span class="code"><span class="text-green">BufferedWriter</span></span> class. There are two constructors for creating an object:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
public BufferedWriter(Writer out) 
public BufferedWriter(Writer out, int sz)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <span class="code">out</span> in both constructors is the stream to write to, and <span class="code">sz</span>, as already mentioned, is the size of the buffer.</p>

<p>The <span class="code"><span class="text-green">BufferedWriter</span></span> class also has several methods. We'll take a closer look at some of them today: </p>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">write(char[] array)</span></td>
<td>Writes a <span class="text-orange">char</span> array to the buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">write(String s, int off, int len)</span></td>
<td>Writes part of a string to the buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">append(char c)</span></td>
<td>Write a character to the buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">append(CharSequence csq, int start, int end)</span></td>
<td>Writes part of an array to the buffer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">newLine()</span></td>
<td>Writes a line separator</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="code text-orange">flush()</span></td>
<td>Flushes the stream</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Let's write a program that will write a value to a file. For the <mark class="green">Writer</mark> parameter, we'll pass a <mark class="green">FileWriter</mark> to the constructor. It is used to write text files and has several constructors to initialize objects: </p>

<div class="terminal">FileWriter(File file)<br />
FileWriter(File file, boolean append)<br />
FileWriter(FileDescriptor fd)<br />
FileWriter(String fileName)<br />
FileWriter(String fileName, boolean append)</div>

<p>For our example, we'll use a constructor that takes a filename:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
try(BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))){
	
	String message = "Hello, Amigo! This is a very important message!";
	bufferedWriter.write(message);
	bufferedWritter.flush();
}
catch(IOException ex){
System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Our code will use the <span class="code text-orange">write(String str)</span> method to write <span class="code">str</span> to the <span class="text-bold">file.txt</span> file.</p>

<p>There are other methods for writing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="code text-orange">write(char[] array</span>) — this variant accepts and writes a <span class="text-orange">char</span> array;</p></li>

<li><p><span class="code text-orange">write(String s, int off, int len)</span> — this variant takes a string <span class="code">s</span>; an offset <span class="code">off</span>, which is index of the character to start writing from; and <span class="code">len</span>, which is the length of the string (substring) to be written.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
try(BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))){
	String message = "Hello, Amigo! This is a very important message!";
	bufferedWriter.write(message, 0, 11);
 	bufferedWriter.flush();

} catch(IOException ex) {
System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code will write "Hello, Amig" to the file, since we told the method to write 11 characters starting from index 0.</p>

<p>Our code also has a <a href="https://codegym.cc/quests/lectures/en.questsyntaxpro.level15.lecture000" target="_blank">try-with resources</a> block:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
try(BufferedWriter bufferedWritter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))) 
</code></pre>

<p>This means that the <span class="code text-orange">close()</span> method is called automatically on my <mark class="green">bufferedWriter</mark> object, because it implements the <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>AutoCloseable</em></span></span> interface.

<p>The <span class="code text-orange">flush()</span> method in the code is used to flush the output stream, forcing all buffered bytes to be written. The write may not occur without this call, since it is what indicates that the buffer must be flushed and that the buffered bytes must be written.</p>

<p>The <span class="code"><span class="text-green">BufferedWriter</span></span> class also has a <span class="code text-orange">newLine()</span> method that adds a new line to our message:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
try (BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))) {
        String message = "Hello, Amigo! This is a very important message!";
        bufferedWriter.write(message, 0, 13);
        bufferedWriter.newLine();
        bufferedWriter.write(message, 15, 33);
    } catch (IOException ex) {
        System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>In the file, we get:</h2>

<div class="terminal">Hello, Amigo!<br />
This is a very important message!</div>

<p>The signature of the <span class="code text-orange">append()</span> method looks like this:</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
public Writer append(CharSequence csq, int start, int end)
</code></pre>

<p>It is used to add <span class="code">csq</span>. Here <span class="code">start</span> is the index of the first character, and <span class="code">end</span> is the index of the last character of the string (or substring) to be inserted. The character with index <span class="code">end</span> is not inserted.</p>

<pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
try (BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))) {
    String message = "Hello, Amigo! This is a very important message!";
    bufferedWriter.append(message, 0, 7);
    bufferedWriter.flush();
} catch (IOException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
}
</code></pre>

<p>This code will give you:</p>

<div class="terminal">Hello,</div>

<p>That is, with the <span class="code text-orange">append</span> method, you specify which part of the string to add to the buffer.</p>

<p>Looking more closely at the difference between <span class="code text-orange">write()</span> and <span class="code text-orange">append()</span>, we first see that they both do the same thing in principle — they write values. </p>

<p>However, the difference is that the <span class="code text-orange">append</span> method is newer and takes a <span class="text-orange">CharSequence</span> as an argument, and because <span class="text-orange">String</span> implements <span class="text-orange">CharSequence</span>, we can pass <span class="text-orange">Strings</span> and <span class="code"><span class="text-green">StringBuilders</span></span>, and <span class="code"><span class="text-green">StringBuffers</span></span> to the <span class="code text-orange">append</span> method. But the <span class="code text-orange">write()</span> method will only accept a <span class="text-orange">String</span>.</p>

<p>That's it for now! Today we got acquainted with buffers, how to perform buffered writing to a file, as well as the methods that you can use to do this.</p>
