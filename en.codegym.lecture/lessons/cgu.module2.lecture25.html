<p>Another type of task pool is the scheduled task pool. Judging by the name, we can assume that we use this type to schedule when a particular task should be launched.</p>

    <p>This type of service is useful when we have a task to launch an activity after some time has elapsed or we want to schedule a recurring task.</p>

    <p>To use one, we call <span class="code text-orange">Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1)</span>.</p>

    <p>We'll talk about the parameters a little later. But for now, what we need to know is that when this method is called we get a <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ScheduledExecutorService</em></span></span> object.</p>

    <p><span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ScheduledExecutorService</em></span></span> is an interface that extends <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>.</p>

    <p>The following methods appear in this interface:</p>
 
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Method</th>
                <th>Explanation</th>
            </tr>

                </td>
                <td>Creates and executes a one-time action that runs after the specified delay.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
&lt;V&gt; ScheduledFuture&lt;V&gt;

                                      long delay, TimeUnit unit);
</code></pre>
                </td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt;
scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command,
                                             long initialDelay,
                                             long period,
                                             TimeUnit unit);
</code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>Creates and executes a recurring action that runs first after the specified initial delay and then again after the specified period. In other words, execution will start after <span class="text-green">initialDelay</span>, then <span class="text-green">initialDelay + period</span>, then <span class="text-green">initialDelay + 2 * period</span>, and so on.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command,
                                                long initialDelay,
                                                long delay,
                                                TimeUnit unit);
</code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>Creates and executes a recurring action that executes first after the specified initial delay, and then again with the specified delay between the completion of one execution and the start of the next.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>So the interface lets us run tasks at regular intervals or after some delay.</p>

    <p>More on the newScheduledThreadPool method.</p>

    <p>We can call it in several ways:</p>

    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize)
</code></pre>
                </td>
                <td><span class="text-green">corePoolSize</span> is the number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
newScheduledThreadPool(int corePoolSize, ThreadFactory threadFactory)
</code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p><span class="text-green">corePoolSize</span> is the number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle.</p>
                    <p><span class="text-green">threadFactory</span> is the factory to use when creating new threads.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Both methods will create a thread pool that can schedule actions to execute after a specified delay or periodically. </p>

    <p>Let's look at an example to see how <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>ScheduledThreadPool</em></span></span> works.</p>

    <p>For example, suppose we have a task to check email every 5 seconds, but this check must not affect the main program and entails the potential consumption of additional resources.</p>

    <p>We have a task class that simulates checking email. </p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
public class Task implements Runnable {
   @Override
   public void run() {
       System.out.println("Checking email...");
   }
}
</code></pre>

    <p>Next, we create a thread pool and schedule the check.

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ScheduledExecutorService executorService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
executorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Task(), 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
</code></pre>

    <p>In the output, every 5 seconds we see:</p>

    <div class="terminal">Checking email...</div>

    <p>In general, we can use such a pool to perform periodic "housekeeping" tasks, as in the example. Housekeeping tasks are tasks that must be performed regardless of what the main program is doing.</p>
