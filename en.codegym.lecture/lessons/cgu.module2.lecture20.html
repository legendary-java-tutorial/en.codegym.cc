<p>When developing a multi-threaded application, we must usually deal with organizing the work of threads. The larger our application and the more threads we need for multithreaded tasks, the more <mark class="green">Runnable</mark> objects we create. </p>

    <p>It should be noted here that creating a thread in Java is a rather expensive operation. If we create a new instance of the thread each time to perform an operation, we will get big problems with performance and, as a result, with the health of the application. </p>

    <p>A <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>thread pool</em></span></span> and <span class="code"><span class="text-green">ThreadPoolExecutor</span></span> come to our aid here.</p>

    <p>A <span class="text-green"><span class="text-bold"><em>thread pool</em></span></span> is a set of pre-initialized threads. Its size can be fixed or variable. </p>

<img data-max-width="512" data-id="29e42550-7f47-455c-9d8b-205c94ea90a1" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/29e42550-7f47-455c-9d8b-205c94ea90a1/512.jpeg" alt="">

    <p>If there are more tasks than threads, then tasks wait in a task queue. The Nth thread in the pool takes a task from the queue, and after it is done, the thread picks up a new task from the queue. Once all tasks in the queue are executed, the threads remain active and wait for new tasks. When new tasks appear, the threads start executing them as well. </p>

    <h2>ThreadPoolExecutor </h2>

    <p>Starting with Java 5, the <span class="text-bold">Executor framework</span> gained a multithreading solution. In general, it has lots of components and its purpose is to help us efficient manage queues and thread pools. </p>

    <p>The main interfaces are <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Executor</em></span></span> and <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span>. </p>

    <p><span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Executor</em></span></span> is an interface with a single void execute(Runnable runnable) method.</p>

    <p>When passing a task to an implementation of this method, know that it will be executed asynchronously in the future. </p>

    <p><span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> — An interface that extends the <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Executor</em></span></span> interface, adding capabilities for executing tasks. It also has methods for interrupting a running task and terminating the thread pool. <p>

    <p><span class="code"><span class="text-green">ThreadPoolExecutor</span></span> implements the <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Executor</em></span></span> and <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>ExecutorService</em></span></span> interfaces and separates task creation from task execution. We need to implement <span class="text-neon"><span class="text-bold"><em>Runnable</em></span></span> objects and send them to an executor. The <span class="code"><span class="text-green">ThreadPoolExecutor</span></span> is then responsible executing the tasks, and creating and working with threads.</p>

    <p>After a task is sent for execution, an existing thread in the pool is used. This improve performance. It solves the problem of wasting resources on creating and initializing a new thread, and then again on garbage collection once we're done with the thread. </p>

    <p><span class="code"><span class="text-green">ThreadPoolExecutor</span></span> has 4 constructors:</p>

    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
ThreadPoolExecutor(
int corePoolSize,
int maximumPoolSize,
long keepAliveTime, 
TimeUnit unit, 
BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; workQueue)
    </code></pre>
 
    <pre class='language-java line-numbers'><code>
