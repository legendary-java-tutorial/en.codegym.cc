<p>"Hello, Amigo! Today we will have a short but interesting lesson. I'm going to tell you about <span class="text-red">yield</span>, a static method of the Thread class."</p>
<p>Ellie has already told you that the processor constantly switches between threads. Each thread is allocated a small piece of processor time, called <strong>a quantum</strong>. When this time expires, the processor switches to another thread and starts executing its commands. Calling <code><span class="text-user">Thread.yield()</span></code> lets you end the current thread's quantum early. In other words, it tells the processor to switch to the next thread.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But why would one thread need to give up its time to another thread?"</span></p>
<p>"It doesn't happen often. Calling <strong>yield</strong> means «our thread is done with its turn ahead of schedule» and that the command after the <strong>yield</strong> will start with a full time quantum. Thus, the chances that it will be interrupted are less. Especially if it's a short command, i.e. it won't take long to execute. This approach can be used to optimize some processes."</p>
<p>I can also tell you that <strong>Thread.sleep(0)</strong> actually works the same way. I think you won't use the <strong>yield</strong> method very much at first, but it's useful to know about.</p>
