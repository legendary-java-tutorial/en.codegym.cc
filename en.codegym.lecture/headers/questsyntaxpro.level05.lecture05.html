jagged arrays in java
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Ragged arrays In Java, as a programmer, you can not only swap the rows of a two-dimensional array, but also construct this array yourself the way you want. Let's say you want the first row of a two-dimensional array to have a length of 10 and the second to have a length of 50. Is it possible to do this? yes you can
