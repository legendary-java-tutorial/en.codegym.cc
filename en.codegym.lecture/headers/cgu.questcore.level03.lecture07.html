Abstract class vs. interface
<p>----------------------------------------</p>

These concepts will very soon become familiar and understandable, but in the learning process it is not always easy to clearly separate one from the other. The teacher Bilaabo and his magic summary table of comparison of abstract classes and interfaces are in a hurry to help.
