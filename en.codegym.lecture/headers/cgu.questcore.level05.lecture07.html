Class loading order, static data...
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
You already know that classes in Java are files on disk that contain bytecode, that is, compiled Java code. The Java machine does not load them unnecessarily. As soon as a class is called somewhere in the code, the Java machine checks to see if it is loaded. In this lecture, you'll learn what happens if it's not loaded... and much more.
