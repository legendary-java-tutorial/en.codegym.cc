Serialization. Start.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
The Java machine knows how to save and load its objects. It doesn't even need save &amp; load methods to do this: all objects are stored inside the Java machine, and it has full access to them. So, serialization is a process built right into the Java machine to save the state of an object into a sequence of bytes.
