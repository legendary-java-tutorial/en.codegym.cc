Multiple inheritance of interfaces
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
They say that there is no multiple inheritance in Java ... It seems to be absent, but it is. There is no multiple inheritance of classes due to some problems (more on them later). But multiple inheritance of interfaces in Java quite exists, and this interesting and powerful tool helps a lot to write rational code.
