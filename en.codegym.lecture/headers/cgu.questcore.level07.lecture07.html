yield - skipping a move
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
You already know that the processor is constantly switching between threads. A quantum is allocated for each thread - a piece of processor time. Time expires - the processor switches to another thread and executes its commands. Well, if you need to terminate the quantum of the current thread ahead of schedule, the static method of the Thread class called yield comes to the rescue!
