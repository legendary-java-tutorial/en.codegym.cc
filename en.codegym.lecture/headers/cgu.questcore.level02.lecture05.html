Abstract classes
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Very often you need to describe something non-specific, basic in the program. For example, "car". It will have an engine and a body. This is not a machine, but just an abstraction - a class that we made for convenience. And already on its base, you can bungled a Ferrari or a Lada. The lecture has details. Interesting.
