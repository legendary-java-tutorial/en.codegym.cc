Method Overloading
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
All methods within a class must have unique names, or rather, a combination of a unique name and a set of parameter types for that method. Imagine that you need to write an Add() method to add two numbers. But you still don't know for sure whether these numbers are int or double. The smart way out is to overload the Add method. Risha will tell you about the rest.
