Useful links from the Professor - 15
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Looking at the same material from different angles is helpful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps the best source of theory for you is different from the one that suits your friend. Especially for you, the professor found a very interesting lecture on the net, from which you will learn even more about overriding methods and constructors.
