Polymorphism and redefinition
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
After this lecture, you will learn what polymorphism is and solve the problem of fathers and children, understanding what needs to be done if the heir already wants to use the method in the way his ancestor did. That is, the situation that a whale is such a cow, only without horns, without bells and swims, will not confuse you. You can even program it.
