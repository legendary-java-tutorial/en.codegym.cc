Interfaces are more than interfaces - they are behaviors
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Imagine that you are a robot builder and you have dozens of robots under your control, each of which can have several professions. You need to urgently complete the wall. You take all the robots that have the "builder" ability and tell them to build a wall. You don't care what kind of robots they are, even sprinklers. If he can build, let him build.
