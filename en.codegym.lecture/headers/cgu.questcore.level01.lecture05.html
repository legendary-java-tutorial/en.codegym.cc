Inheritance. Advantage of Inheritance
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
There lived a horse. He plucked the grass, galloped at a gallop, did not touch anyone. Then a programmer came, and the horse had an heir - Pegasus, a horse with wings. Favorite muses concurrently. He looked like a horse, knew how to pluck grass and gallop. Also, he could fly. This is how children appear in Java. Details are in the lecture.
