Creating an object. Constructor calling order
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
If you created an object of a class, what happens in memory? At what point are variables assigned values &ZeroWidthSpace;&ZeroWidthSpace;when a constructor is called? Such things are very useful to know. And not only because you will be asked at the interview, but when you are familiar with the process, it is much easier for you to imagine what will work and how.
