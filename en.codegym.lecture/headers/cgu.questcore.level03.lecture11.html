Galaxy Rush Captain Bobrov is in touch! He has a couple of surprises for you. More precisely, not a couple, and not surprises, but as many as ten tasks to consolidate knowledge about abstract classes and interfaces. And the most inquisitive can try their hand at solving three bonus puzzles, to solve them you need to think carefully.
