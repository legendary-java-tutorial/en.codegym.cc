Collectors in Java
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Collecting Elements Finally, we come to the most interesting method in the Stream class, the collect() method. This method is used to finally move from streams to familiar collections - List&lt;T&gt;, Set&lt;T&gt;, Map&lt;T, R&gt; and others. You need to pass a special object to the collect() method.
