<p>"My young friend, I've always said: don't postpone until dinner what you can eat for lunch. In other words, don't postpone until tomorrow what you can learn today! I found an excellent article just for you about the difference between abstract classes and interfaces."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But Doctor Bilaabo explained that to me in five minutes!"</span></p>
<p>"With detailed examples?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user"> "Absolutely."</span></p> 
<p>"Read this lesson: <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/104-the-difference-between-abstract-classes-and-interfaces' target='_blank'>Difference between abstract classes and interfaces</a>. You'll also learn something new about the InputStream and OutputStream interfaces. After that, you'll definitely be able to say you have no more questions :)"</p>
