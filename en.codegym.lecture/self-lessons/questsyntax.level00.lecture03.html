Ready for the first program
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Just imagine: within 10 minutes you will be writing your first Java program! But first a wise teacher will tell you something else important about the command to display text on the console (though the true meaning of all the elements of the command will be revealed to you a little later) and class methods.Classes and methods - these words will gradually become meaningful.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>(an hour later)</p>
<p>"Terrific! Where did we stop?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"The code inside a method or something like that."</span></p>
<p>"Right. Exactly. <span class="green_text text-green">The body of a method consists of commands. </span><span class="--violet_text">We could even say that a method is a group of commands that has been given a name (method name).</span> Both statements would be true."</p>
<p>"There are all sorts of commands. Are there dogs on your planet?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Only domesticated robotic wolves."</span></p>
<po>"Do they execute commands?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yep. 'Bite', 'Eat', 'Tear', and 'Good! Heel!'"</span></p>

<p>"Hmm. Nice commands! But there aren't very many of them."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"How many do we need?"</span></p>
<p>"The Java language has commands for every occasion. Each command describes some action. At the end of each command, we use a semicolon."</p>
<p>"Here are some examples of commands:"</p>

    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Command</th>
        <th>Description (what it does)</th>

        <td>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java inline-block" data-line="" data-start=""><code>System.out.println(<span
        class="text-green">1</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>"Actually, this is just one command <code>System.out.println</code>. <span class="text-viola">We use parentheses to pass arguments to the command. Depending on the value of the arguments, the same command can execute different actions."</span>
</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's very convenient."</span></p>
<p>"Yes. <span class="text-green">If you want to display some text on the screen, you put double quotes on each side of it.</span></p>
<p>A single quotation mark looks like this: <code>'</code>. A double quotation mark looks like this: <code>"</code>. A double quotation mark is not the same thing as two single quotation marks. Please don't confuse them."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"The key for the double quotation mark is next to the Enter button on the keyboard, right?"</span></p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>Amigo’s pulse accelerated from 3 to 5 GHz. He still couldn’t believe it. He had just learned how to print strings on the screen, and it turned out to be much easier that he had expected.<br/>
    Amigo looked out the window to distract himself from his thoughts and calm down. The leaves were turning yellow. The Rusty Season is very close, he noted automatically. An illuminator let him see much further than usual. The newcomers’ technology was very advanced indeed. But did he care about the leaves now? He would multiply his knowledge again by evening!</p>

<p>But his thoughts wouldn’t calm down. One day, he’d write a program to make all robots take refuge in their homes during the Rusty Season. That program alone would save thousands of robo-lives…</p>
<p>"This command has two versions: <code>System.out.print<span class="text-red">ln</span>()</code>  and  <code>System.out.print()</code>"</p>
<p>"If you use the <code>System.out.println()</code> command a few times, you’ll see that each time the text you pass to the command is displayed on a separate line. If you use the <code>System.out.print()</code> command, the text is displayed on the same line. For example:"</p>

<p>"Keep this in mind: <code>print<span class="red_text text-red">ln</span></code> doesn't start printing text from a new line. It prints text on the current line, but makes it so the next text will be printed on a new line."</p>
<p>"The <code>println()</code> command prints the text on the screen and adds a special unseen 'newline character'. This is what makes the next text start on a new line."</p>
