<p>"Greetings, Amigo! I hear you already have a good grasp of methods?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hi, Rishi. Yes, I've already cut my way through that teacher's trick. I would say that it wasn't so bad, but you'll tell me, 'No, no! You haven't figured out anything.'"</span></p>
<p>"You've clearly been spending too much time chatting with certain teachers, probably with Diego. Anyway... I still hope you understand methods well enough. After all, today I'm going to teach you some magic words that help delineate methods' spheres of influence."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Sounds intriguing."</span></p>
<p>"In fact, it's all simple. Before each method, programmers can specify so-called access modifiers. These include the following keywords: <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>.</p>
<p>"These access modifiers let you restrict other classes' access to a method.</p>
<p>"For example, if you write the <code>private</code> keyword before a method declaration, then the method can only be called from the same class in which it is declared. The <code>public</code> keyword allows access to the marked method from any method of any class.</p>
<p>There are a total of 3 such modifiers , but there are 4 types of access to a method. This is because the absence of an access modifier also means something. Here's a complete table:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th colspan="4">Access from...</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Modifiers</td>
        <td>Any class</td>
        <td>Child class</td>
        <td>Its package</td>
        <td>Its class</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>public</code></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>protected</code></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>no modifier</td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>private</code></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-red">No</span></strong></td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">Yes</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>"And here is a complete explanation of the access modifiers:</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">1. <code>public</code> modifier</span></p>
<p>A method (or variable, or class) marked with the <code>public</code> modifier can be accessed <span class="text-green">from anywhere in the program</span>. This is the highest degree of openness — there are no restrictions.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">2. <code>private</code> modifier</span></p>
<p>A method (or variable, or class) marked with the <code>private</code>modifier can only be accessed <span class="text-red">from the same class where it is declared</span>. For all other classes, the marked method (or variable) is invisible. It's as if it does not exist. This is the highest level of restriction — only its own class.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">3. No modifier (default modifier)</span></p>
<p>If a method (or variable) is not marked with any modifier, then it is considered to have the 'default modifier'. Variables or methods with that modifier (i.e. with none at all) are <span class="text-red">visible to all classes in the package in which they are declared</span>. And only to them. This modifier is also sometimes called <code>package-private</code>, hinting that access to variables and methods is open to the entire package in which their class is located.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">4. <code>protected</code> modifier</span></p>
<p>If a method is marked with the <code>protected</code> modifier, then it can be accessed from the same class, the same package, and descendants (classes that inherit the class in which the method is declared). We will analyze this topic in more detail in the Java Core quest."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Interesting, but I'm not sure whether I can immediately put these modifiers in all the right places.</span></p>
<p>"You'll get there gradually. No need to worry ahead of time. Until you reach the end of the Java Syntax quest, you can use the <code>public</code> modifier on all your methods (as well as classes and instance variables). You will need the other modifiers when we start actively learning OOP."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Can you explain in more detail why access modifiers are needed?"</span></p>
<p>"They become necessary for large projects written by tens and hundreds of programmers at the same time.</p>
<p>"Sometimes there are situations when a programmer wants to split an excessively large method into parts and move part of the code into helper methods. But at the same time, he or she doesn't want other programmers to call these helper methods, because the corresponding code may not work correctly."</p>
<p>"So they came up with these access modifiers. If you mark a helper method with the word <span class="text-bold">private</span>, then no code other than your class can see your helper method."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I think I understand."</span></p>

<h2><code>static</code> keyword</h2>
<p>"There is another interesting keyword. It is <code>static</code>. Unsurprisingly, it makes methods static."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What does that mean?"</span></p>
<p>"I'll tell you more about it later. Don't worry. For now, just try to remember a couple of facts about static methods.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">Fact 1.</span> A static method is not attached to any object, but instead belongs to the class in which it is declared. To call a static method, you need to write:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present language-java"><code><span class="text-orange">ClassName</span>.<span class="text-red">MethodName</span>()</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Examples of static methods:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Class name</th>
        <th>Static method name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>Thread.<span class="text-red">sleep</span>()</code>
        </td>
        <td><code>Thread</code></td>
        <td><code>sleep()</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>Math.<span class="text-red">abs</span>()</code>
        </td>
        <td><code>Math</code></td>
        <td><code>abs()</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <code>Arrays.<span class="text-red">sort</span>()</code>
        </td>
        <td><code>Arrays</code></td>
        <td><code>sort()</code></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The <span class="text-orange">class name</span> before the <span class="text-red">name of a static method</span> can be omitted if you call the static method from within its class. This is why you don't need to write <code>Solution</code> before the names of each of the static methods that are called.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">Fact 2.</span> A static method cannot access the non-static methods of its own class. A static method can only access static methods. As a result, we declare all the methods that we want to call from the <code>main</code> method static."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Why is that?"</span></p>
<p>"You will answer this question yourself when you start learning OOP and understand how static methods work. Until then, just trust me.</p>
<div class="task-widget-container" showCover="true" taskKey="en.javarush.task.pro.task06.task0611"></div>
<h2><code>throws</code> keyword</h2>
<p>"There is another keyword that you've probably seen in a method declaration — the <code>throws</code> keyword. Unlike access modifiers and the <code>static</code> keyword, this keyword is placed <span class="text-bold">after</span> the method parameters:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
        <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present language-java"><code>public static <span class="text-viola">Type</span> <span class="text-user">name</span>(<span class="text-neon">parameters</span>) throws <span class="text-red">Exception</span>
{
&nbsp; <span class="text-green">method body</span>
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span class="text-user">"And what does it mean?"</span></p>
<p>"Once again I have to tell you that you will learn its true purpose later, when we study exceptions (in Level 15).</p>
<p>But to touch on it superficially, we can say that a method marked with the <code>throws</code> keyword can throw errors (exceptions), meaning instances of the <code><span class="text-red">Exception</span></code> class (and classes that inherit it). If several different types of errors can occur in a class, then you need to list each of them separated by commas."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Sounds mysterious and incomprehensible! I'll have to wait for Level 14."</span></p>
<h2>main method</h2>
<p>"Let's now take a closer look at the main method. You already understand that the line where a method is declared, which contains all the modifiers, will affect how this method is called from other classes and methods. Additionally, it affects the type of result the method will return and indicates what errors are possible as it runs.</p>
<p>"Such a line is called a <span class="text-bold">method declaration</span> and has the following general format:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-green">access modifier</span> static <span class="text-viola">Type</span> <span class="text-user">name</span>(<span class="text-neon">parameters</span>) throws <span class="text-red">exceptions</span></code></pre>
    <div class="lesson-example-caption">General format of a method declaration</div>
</div>
<p>Where <code><span class="text-green">access modifiers</span></code> is replaced by <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, or nothing at all;</p>
<p>if the method is static, then the <code>static</code> keyword appears (it is absent for non-static methods)</p>
<p><code><span class="text-viola">Type</span></code> is the type of the return value (<code>void</code> if there is no result)</p>
<p>"Now you have a much better understanding of what all these words mean in the declaration of the <code><span class="text-user">main</span></code> method:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
    <pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-green">public</span> static <span class="text-viola">void</span> <span class="text-user">main</span>(<span class="text-neon">String[] args</span>) throws <span class="text-red">Exception</span></code></pre>
    <div class="lesson-example-caption">Declaring the <code>main</code> method</div>
</div>
<p><span class="text-user">"Well, now I realize that access to the <code><span class="text-user">main</span>()</code> method is possible from any class, as indicated by the <code><span class="text-green">public</span></code> keyword. The method is static, so it can be called explicitly as <code>Solution.main()</code>."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What result does the <code>main()</code> method return?"</span></p>
<p>"None at all! The result type is <code><span class="text-viola">void</span></code>. It's kind of like an empty type, a placeholder."</p>
<p>"What does <code>main()</code> have in its parentheses?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm... It turns out that the <code>main</code> method takes arguments (!). They are passed in as an array of strings."</span></p>
<p>"That's right. And the parameter name <code>args</code> suggests 'arguments' to our minds. When the program starts, you can pass it arguments — an array of strings. They will be contained in the <code><span class="text-neon">args</span></code> array in the <code>main()</code> method."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Whoa! I wondered about this when I saw it the first time, but then I got used to it and started writing the parameter list without thinking."</span></p>
<p>"We've all been there. Finally, unhandled errors like <code><span class="text-red">Exception</span></code> (or its descendants) can occur in the <code>main()</code> method. We know this thanks to the <code>throws Exception</code> part of the declaration."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Thank you, Rishi. I didn't understand everything, but this was interesting."</span></p>
<p>"You are welcome. Gradually you'll come to understand all these subtle points, I'm sure."</p>
