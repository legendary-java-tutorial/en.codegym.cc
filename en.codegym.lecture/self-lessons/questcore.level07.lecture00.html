You've reached Level 17!
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Congratulations, you've completed the sixth level of the quest! You've touched on an important topic (threads) and completed 34 tasks (or perhaps less if you left some for later). On the seventh level, we'll continue to study threads. In the near future, we'll deal with the static method yield and the keywords synchronized and volatile.
