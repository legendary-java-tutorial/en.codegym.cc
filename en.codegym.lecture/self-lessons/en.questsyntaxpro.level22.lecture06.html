<p>The computer revolution that began at the end of the 20th century led to the creation of the Internet (web) in mid-90s. And this sparked an even greater revolution. The Internet's effect is comparable to that of industrialization. But the most interesting fact is that this process is still in its infancy.</p>
<h2>A new world</h2>
<p>There are more than 200 million websites. Three billion people use the Internet. Online auctions, websites, online shopping, online services… The IT economy is growing at 20%-30% annually. These numbers are incredible. And the growth isn't slowing.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, a new company later valued at a billion dollars was founded every other month in Silicon Valley (the IT center of the world). And that doesn't include Internet stars like Facebook ($220 billion), Amazon ($140 billion) and Google ($350 billion). None of these companies would exist without the Internet.</p>
<p>As a result, IT specialists are in high demand. The global IT industry needs programmers, designers, testers, architects, managers, system administrators and other specialists.</p>
<h2>It's good to be an IT specialist</h2>

<p>If you're an IT specialist, this is your golden hour. You can work for a western company while living in a small town—or even a different country. Of course, your wages will be lower than in the West (by a factor of two or more), but they will be higher than in the local labor market (3-10 times higher). The smaller your town is, the more noticeable the difference will be.</p>
<p>You'll gain valuable work experience, good money, and bright prospects. Sometimes you'll take business trips to your employer's office. If you really like it there, you can also move there.</p>
<p>The tide lifts all boats. Why not be a boat that happens to be in the right place at the right time? You need to know how to make that happen too.</p>
<h2>Emigration prospects</h2>
<p>In the West, IT specialists are among the trio of most highly-paid professions, which also includes doctors and lawyers. The average salary for a programmer is about $90,000 per year. Most interestingly, IT professions are incredibly well-suited for the global labor market.</p>
<p>What happens if a doctor wants to move to another country? Another country means different medical standards. It's unlikely that her diploma will let her work in a different country. She'll have to learn the language, pass exams, and complete a residency. It's a long path.</p>
<p>It's even worse for lawyers. Laws in one country differ from the laws in another. In one country, connections are everything, while in other countries, it's common law that matters. Good lawyers in one country won't be so good in another.</p>
<p>IT specialists. Quite often, they work for large western companies, directly or through intermediaries. The same technologies, the same business processes. All online documentation is in English. Your resume should be in English. You can move to any country in the world, and nothing will change. Even the clients/employers are often the same.</p>
<p>IT specialists in California have fantastic wages. This is why you should always be progressing.</p>
