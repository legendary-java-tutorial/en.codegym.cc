Constructors/variables of anonymous inner classes, and final
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
"Hi, Amigo!" "As you already know, anonymous inner classes can't have a constructor." "Yeah. It's not very convenient. Constructors are really important." "As the saying goes, nothing's impossible if you want it bad enough." "Remember, static variables don't have static constructors, but there is a static initializer – the static block." "Yeah, I remember." "Anonymous inner classes have the exact same initializer ..."
