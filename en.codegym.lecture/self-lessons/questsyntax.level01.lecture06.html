Concluding a contract
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Trust is everything to us. And practice is also everything to us. As a result, "trust and practice are everything to us". Still, before signing a contract, you need to carefully study its terms and conditions! Believe me, this will only make your salary higher: companies love attentive employees. And in programming, attention to detail is worth its weight of gold.

You need to fill out an application. Here's the standard form. <span class="text-green">Just display its text on the screen, and that's it.</span> Sign without reading it. That's what I always do."</p>
