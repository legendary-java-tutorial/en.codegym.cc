<p>"I want to tell you about a few more magic tricks."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Please do! Today is simply a day of miracles. It seems I haven't been using half of IntelliJ IDEA's features."</span></p>
<h3>Magic trick #4: Search.</h3>
<p>"Imagine that you've opened a file with 5,000 lines, and you need to find a method called getProcessTask. Or getProcessorTask or getTaskProcessor or something like that."</p>
<p>"IntelliJ IDEA has a very powerful mechanism for searching the current open file."</p>
<p>"Just press Ctrl+F and start typing the word you need:"</p>

<p>"For example, if we want to find every call to the println method, then we'd type println:"</p>

<p>"And you can navigate through the matches using the up and down arrows. I've circled them the screenshot."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"There are more checkboxes on the right: Match Case, Regex, and Words. What do they mean?"</span></p>
<p>"<strong>MatchCase</strong> makes the search case sensitive. <span class="text-corporate">If cleared, there is no distinction made between uppercase and lowercase letters. If selected, then uppercase and lowercase letters are considered different. For example, «Print» wouldn't match «print».</span>"</p>
<p>"Selecting the <strong>Regex</strong> checkbox <span class="text-viola">tells IntelliJ that the search string is actually a regular expression.</span>"</p>
<p>"Selecting the <strong>Words</strong> checkbox <span class="text-green">indicates that a word must completely match what we have. Partial matches don't count.</span>"</p>
<p>"For example, if I have <strong>print</strong> and <strong>println</strong>, methods and I only want to find print, then I'll need to check this box. In the example below, I specifically replaced two occurrences of <strong>println</strong> with <strong>print</strong>, and found only those two by selecting the <strong>Words</strong> checkbox."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"In other words, Words switches between «part of the word matches the search string» and «the whole word matches the search string»?"</span></p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<h3>Magic trick #5: Replace.</h3>
<p>"Imagine you have some code and you want to replace a few method calls with other method calls. "You simply want to replace a code fragment with another code fragment. That's it. How can you do that quickly?"</p>
<p>"The Ctrl+R key combination does this."</p>

<a href='https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/6821d99e-6eaf-4f96-95b5-c288a6882adf/original.jpeg' target='_blank'><img data-id="6821d99e-6eaf-4f96-95b5-c288a6882adf" data-max-width="1024" alt="IDEA: replace, find - 4" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/6821d99e-6eaf-4f96-95b5-c288a6882adf/original.jpeg"></a>

<p>"Let's replace <strong>println</strong>  with <strong>print</strong>.</p>
<p>"To make sure the replacement operation doesn't happen in the entire class, you need to select the desired part of the code and select the «In Selection» checkbox."</p>

<a href='https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/aa3e07a8-17c8-4c4e-9d54-61001fa92707/original.jpeg' target='_blank'><img data-id="aa3e07a8-17c8-4c4e-9d54-61001fa92707" data-max-width="1024" alt="IDEA: replace, find - 5" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/aa3e07a8-17c8-4c4e-9d54-61001fa92707/original.jpeg"></a>

<p>"Now you can boldly press the «<strong>Replace</strong> <strong>all</strong>» button and all <strong>println</strong> entries in the selected code will be replaced with <strong>print</strong>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's true. Everything works great. Thank you, Ellie!"</span></p>
