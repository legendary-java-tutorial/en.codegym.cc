<p><span class="text-user">"Professor, are you really leaving your post? Because I'm definitely not going to stop and abandon my studies. You said that you need to learn without stopping, and give lectures, and books, and... In general, a programmer needs to grow constantly."</span></p>
<p>"I'm glad you learned these lessons well. "You know who to turn to if you ever want to understand the theory properly. But I think that soon you, my student, will surpass your teacher.</p>
<p>"And of course, I finally picked out something for you!</p>

<p>Let's immediately clarify something: there is no code without bugs... This is just how life works. So, we shouldn't fall to pieces and give up if our code doesn't work as we expected.</p>
<p>But what should we do? Well, we could put System.out.println statements everywhere and then comb through the console output in the hopes of finding an error.</p>
<p>That said, you can (and people do) debug using careful logging.</p>
<p>But if you can run your code on a local machine, it's better to use Debug mode. In this article, we will consider debugging a project using IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>As you learn programming, most of the time (except when digging into theory), you write code and then write some more. This in part means that most beginning developers believe that this is what they will do in the future. That's all fine and well, but a programmer's job also includes maintaining and refactoring code. Today we're going to talk about refactoring.</p>
<p>In this two-part article, you will find a small guide (set of recommendations) for writing better code. Let's go over the basic rules and concepts related to creating a system and working with interfaces, classes, and objects. Let's go!</p>-->
