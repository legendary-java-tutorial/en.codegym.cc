<p><big><strong>Java serialization formats</strong></big></p>
<p>You're already familiar with serialization — several lessons have been devoted to this topic. <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/217-java-serialization-formats" target="_blank">This time we'll explore</a> some theoretical foundations and talk about serialization formats — JSON, YAML and others.</p>
<p><big><strong>What is XML?</strong></big></p>
<p>When working on real Java applications, you will almost certainly encounter XML-related tasks. In Java development, this format is used almost universally (<a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/212-what-is-xml" target="_blank">you'll find out exactly why in this article</a>), so I recommend that you don't superficially review this lesson, but rather gain a thorough understanding of everything and also study additional literature/links :)</p>
