Unboxing a quantum computer
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
We have this tradition at CodeGym: near the end of each level, your teacher Julio invites you to watch a fascinating IT video. Sit back and relax. You'll learn something new and even get some dark matter... Today weâ€™ll visit D-Wave Systems, the world's first quantum computing company. Its systems are widely used by Google, NASA, Volkswagen, and others.
