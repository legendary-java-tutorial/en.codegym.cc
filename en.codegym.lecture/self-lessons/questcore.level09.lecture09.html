Useful links from the Professor — 19
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Of course, looking at the same material from different angles is useful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps for you the best source of the theory will be different from the source best suited to your friend. And sometimes it's helpful to reread what we've already read. Today is one of those times. Let's reread the article about input/output streams.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Amigo, congratulations! You are one step away from the end of the next big stage of your training. I always said you would be a huge success."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Thank you, Professor! Now I know all about streams in Java, and Diego's tasks helped me better understand what's happening."</span></p>
<p>"That's great. But I have a couple more lessons for you that will definitely help you gain a deeper understanding of the topic. Sit back, get comfortable, and carefully read a couple of articles.</p>
<p><big><strong>Adapter design pattern</strong></big></p> 
<p>"In programming, as in many other areas, there are a large number of common situations that everyone encounters. To avoid reinventing the wheel every time, it's better to use ready-made solutions that work. In programming, they are called design patterns. There are a lot of them. In <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/247-adapter-design-pattern' target='_blank'>this article</a>, we'll talk about the adapter pattern.</p>
<p><big><strong>Practice working with the BuffreredReader and InputStreamReader classes</strong></big></p> 
<p>Once again, we'll review familiar material about the BufferedReader and InputStreamReader class, this time with more complex examples that you'll certainly understand at this stage of your training. We'll also <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/248-practice-working-with-the-buffreredreader-and-inputstreamreader-classes' target='_blank'>consider</a> how to replace System.out.</p>
