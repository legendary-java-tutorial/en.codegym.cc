<h2>1. Contacting customer support</h2>
<p>If you encounter any difficulties while using CodeGym, you can always contact our customer support. The easiest way to do this is through the <a href="https://codegym.cc/dialogues/administration" target="_blank">"Administration" </a>section in the "Messages" section of the website.</p>

<p>The separate section is for your convenience and privacy. Most questions are answered within a few hours. However, some complex cases may require the involvement of additional specialists or may even be considered by top management.</p>
<p>Depends on if your lucky. Or not.</p>

<h2>2. Chatting with customer support</h2>
<p>There is another convenient way to contact customer support representatives â€” the chat feature, which you access via the icon located in the lower right corner of the website. This method will be most convenient for those who have not yet registered on the website.</p>
<p>There is no fundamental difference between these two methods. That said, you may get a response a little faster via chat.</p>
