<h2>1. Learning only the Java language</h2>

<p>When compared with other educational platforms, CodeGym is unique in that <strong>we only teach how to program in Java</strong>. We are constantly working to make your learning experience more effective, more fun, and more accessible. As a result, we have become <span class="text-bold">one of the most popular resources for learning Java</span>.</p>
<p>If we, like many others, started adding courses in C#, JavaScript, Python, etc., then we would quickly become just another website among thousands that <span class="text-red">teach everything but in a mediocre way</span>. Our goal is to make the <strong>indisputably best Java learning site in the world.</strong></p>
<p>That means we often have to deny ourselves the pleasure of making another course covering the latest hyped topic. Instead, for the umpteenth time, we refine the same lessons and improve the same tasks. As they say, perfect is the enemy of good ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>So let's take a quick look at what we have today on CodeGym.</p>

<h2>2. Quest map</h2>

<p>CodeGym's entire Java course is divided into 4 blocks called quests. These quests are <span class="term">Java Syntax</span>, <span class="term">Core</span>, <span class="term">Collections</span> and <span class="term">Multithreading</span>. Each quest consists of levels. There are 18 levels in the first quest and 10 in each consequent quest. Just a few, right?</p>
<p>Each level, in turn, consists of 10-15 lessons and about 30 practical tasks. That all amounts to 1200 tasks and 600 lessons. Now things are getting interesting!</p>
<p>The tasks gradually become more difficult. The initial tasks can be solved in a couple of minutes. Tasks at the end of the course may take hours or even days to complete. Completing the entire course will give you 500-1000 hours of programming experience. This is the minimum you need to establish your ability to "think like a programmer".</p>
<p>It will take 6 to 12 months to complete the entire course, depending on your level of training, diligence, and the amount of time you are willing to devote to learning Java.</p>

<h2>3. Levels and lessons</h2>
<img data-id="d7183e96-f5ce-47c6-a091-b4efc13c417b" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/d7183e96-f5ce-47c6-a091-b4efc13c417b/1080.jpeg" alt="Levels and lessons">
<p>All the quests are divided into levels. Each level consists of 10-15 lessons. Lessons, in turn, can contain tasks. There are lessons without any tasks, and there are lessons with more than ten tasks.</p>
<p>And to make the learning more interesting for you, all the training takes the form of a game. In many games, you gain experience by killing monsters and leveling up. Each new level gives you some interesting new opportunities. It's the same in CodeGym.</p>
<p>In CodeGym, you solve tasks and get <strong>black matter</strong> as a reward.</p>

<p>You can spend this black matter to unlock the next lessons and levels. And the new levels bring you new lessons and new tasks. To complete the entire Java course, you will have to solve at least 80% of all the tasks.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Black matter</h2>
<p>Lessons can only be unlocked in order. You cannot open a lesson somewhere in the middle of the course without first unlocking all the lessons before it. <span class="text-orange">What's more, in order to unlock the next lesson, you must first "save up" enough dark matter, and then use it to "buy" the next lesson:</span></p>

<p>If you have enough black matter, then the lesson will open, and you will see the following message:</p>

<p>If you don't have enough black matter, then you will see another message:</p>

<h2>5. Recent lesson (Continue)</h2>
<p>If you return to the website after a long absence and want to quickly get back to the last lesson you opened, there are 2 quick ways to do this:</p>
<p><strong>Method one</strong></p>
<p>Open the quest you are currently working on. Next to the last level you opened, you will see a "Continue" link. Click it and you will be taken to the last lesson you opened in this quest.</p>

<p><strong>Method two</strong></p>
<p>Click <a href="https://codegym.cc/learn" target="_blank">Learning</a> in the upper left corner of the website. There will be a list of the last three lessons you opened. The most recent lesson is the leftmost. Click the desired card and â€” boom â€” you're in the lesson.</p>
