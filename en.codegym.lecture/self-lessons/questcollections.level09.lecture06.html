<p>"You'll find that real projects usually have thousands of files. They include java, properties, xml, html, css, and js files — and much more."</p>
<p>"Sometimes you'll remember the name of a file or class, but won't remember its exact location. IntelliJ IDEA has a way to rapidly navigate files and classes."</p>
<p>"Press Ctrl+Shift+N and the file search dialog will open. You can usually just enter the first letters of a file name and then select the file you need from the list of matches."</p>
<p>"Here's an example of this search box:"</p>

<p>"I pressed Ctrl+Shift+N, which opens the window for entering a file name."</p>
<p>"I typed 'ind', and IDEA showed me a complete list of files with paths matching that pattern."</p>
<p>"You can also just search for classes. To do this, press Ctrl+N. The same window appears, but it will only search for classes."</p>
<p>"This is convenient for navigating to any class available to the project. Including classes from the project's JAR files the JDK."</p>
<p>"For example, I'll try to find <strong>StringBuffer</strong>:"</p>

<p>"Remember how I once told you that if a class name consists of several words, then the first letter of each word is capitalized."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yep. That's called camel case, right?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. Anyway, when searching by class name, you can also search using camel case, i.e. you can search using capital letters. In other words, you don't have to write <strong><span class="text-red">S</span>tring<span class="text-red">B</span>uffer</strong>. You can just enter <strong><span class="text-user text-red">S</span>tr<span class="text-red">B</span>uff</strong> or even <span class="text-red"><strong>SB.</strong></span>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So, you can just write the first letters of each word in the class name?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. If you're looking for <strong>Buffered<span class="text-red">I</span>nput<span class="text-red">S</span>tream</strong>, then of course you can enter the whole name, but that takes a long time. Instead, you can enter something like <strong><span class="text-red">B</span>u<span class="text-red">I</span>n<span class="text-red">S</span>tr</strong> and quickly jump to the class:"</p>
