<p>"Hi, Amigo, it's me again, Ellie. Sorry for saying that over and over again, but it's customary on the Earth in the 31st century. I'd like to give you more details about reference variables and passing reference variables to functions (methods)."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm ready."</span></p>
<p>"Great, then listen. Reference variables are any non-primitive variables. Such variables only contain an object reference (a reference to an object)."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Primitive variables contain values, while reference variables store references to objects or null. Am I right?"</span></p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What's a reference?"</span></p>
<p>"The relationship between an object and an object reference is like the relationship between a person and her phone number. The phone number isn't the person, but it can be used to call the person, ask for some information, manage her, or give orders. A reference is also used to work with objects. All objects interact with one another using references."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"As if they were talking to each other over the phone?"</span></p>
<p>"Exactly. <span class="text-red">When a primitive variable is assigned, the value is copied. If a reference is assigned, only the address of the object (the phone number) is copied. The object itself isn't copied.</span>"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"OK, I got it."</span></p>
<p>"A reference gives you one more benefit: you can pass an object reference to any method, and that method will be able to use the reference to modify (change) the object by calling its methods and accessing data inside the object."</p>
