<p>"Hi, it's your favorite teacher again. Since you're making such great progress, I've decided to tell you about objects and how to work with them."</p>
<p>"<span class="text-green">To create an object, you need to type the keyword 'new' followed by its type name (class name).</span> For example, suppose we have a class named 'Cat':"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"What would happen if we created an object and didn't save a reference in any variable?"</span></p>
<p>"If we just create an object without assigning it to a variable, the Java machine will create it and then declare it garbage (an unused object). After a while, the object will be disposed of during <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/16-more-about-the-garbage-collector-' target='_blank'>garbage collection</a>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"How do I dispose of an object I don't need anymore?"</span></p>
<p>"You don't. <span class="text-red">As soon as no variables refer to an object, it is labeled as garbage and destroyed by the Java machine the next time it collects garbage.</span>"</p>
<p><span class="text-green">As long as there is at least one reference to an object, it's considered active and will not be destroyed.</span> If you want to dispose of an object sooner, you can clear all references to it by assigning <strong>null</strong> to all variables that reference it.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I see. Compared to the last few lessons, this looks pretty simple."</span></p>
