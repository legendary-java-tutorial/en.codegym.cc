Arrays

<p>"I want to tell you about the two utility classes that you've already encountered."</p>
<p>"The <b>Arrays</b> and <b>Collections</b> classes. All their methods are static and designed to work with collections and arrays."</p>
<p>"I'll start with the simpler one: <b>Arrays</b>. Here are its methods:"</p>

            The array must be sorted!<br />

        <td>Performs a deep comparison of two arrays. Arrays are considered equal if their elements are equal. If the elements themselves are arrays, then a deep comparison is also performed on them.</td>

<p><span class="text-user">"Well, these are very useful methods. Many would be helpful to me."</span></p>
<p>I'd also like to mention that I haven't presented all of the methods here. Almost all of the methods in the table have identical counterparts for all the primitive types. For example, the table has a String toString(<b>int</b>[] a) method, and the class also has String toString(<b>boolean</b>[] a), String toString(<b>byte</b>[] a), String toString(<b>long</b>[] a), String toString(<b>float</b>[] a), String toString(<b>double</b>[] a), and String toString(<b>char</b>[] a) methods."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Well, that changes things. That makes it a simply indispensable class."</span></p>
<p>"I'm glad you liked it. Well, we'll continue after a break."</p>
