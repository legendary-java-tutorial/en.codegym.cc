<h2>1. Start here</h2>
<p>Hi. If you are reading these lines, then, yes, you're in the right place: these are Java lessons. Our training course is chock full of practice (1500+ practical tasks) and is designed for both total beginners of school age and adults willing to switch to programming career. Boring lessons are not our style, so we created CodeGym as an online game (quest).</p>
<p>If you've never programmed or studied programming, if you're over 30 and decided to change your profession, if you're bored by learning to programming from textbooks or you're just plain lazy(!) â€” CodeGym is exactly what you need. Learning in a game-like setting is awesome!</p>
<p>Have you ever played games where you level up characters? Sometimes you don't even notice how absorbed in the game you've become, right? Can you guess where I'm going with this? In CodeGym, you will also level up a character. <strong>Complete the entire course and become a cool Java programmer.</strong></p>
<p>If you pass all the levels, you will be able to get a job as a junior Java developer. Of course, there are some people who have found jobs after finishing only half of the course. All this is possible because CodeGym has lots of practical tasks. A lot.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the distant, distant future â€” in 3210, when humans live on Earth with robots, and interstellar travel is commonplace.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, a spaceship plowed through the vast expanse of the universe...</p>

<h2>2. Happy travels!</h2>
<p>You are starting from the first level. <strong>Your objective is to take Amigo all the way up to the highest level.</strong> But let's start small: first get to the second level of CodeGym. Maybe you'll enjoy it so much that you won't notice how quickly you complete the entire course and get a job ðŸ˜‰</p>
