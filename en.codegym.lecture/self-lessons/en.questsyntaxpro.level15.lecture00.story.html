<p>"Amigo, ten-hut!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm happy to learn Java, Captain!"</span></p>
<p>"At ease, Amigo. Today we have a super interesting topic. We will talk about how a Java program interacts with external resources and we'll study one very interesting Java statement. Better not cover your ears."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm all ears."</span></p>
<p>"As a Java program runs, sometimes it interacts with entities outside the Java machine. For example, with files on disk. These entities are usually called external resources."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Then what are considered internal resources?"</span></p>
<p>"Internal resources are the objects created inside the Java machine. Typically, the interaction follows this scheme:</p>
<img data-max-width="1024" data-id="3f96be77-d3c0-469d-a183-2f7570a27bff" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/3f96be77-d3c0-469d-a183-2f7570a27bff/1024.jpeg" alt="Try-with-resources statement">
<p>"The operating system rigorously <span class="text-bold">keeps track of the resources available</span>, and also controls shared access to them from different programs. For example, if one program changes a file, then another program cannot change (or delete) that file. This principle isn't limited to files, but they provide the most readily understandable example.</p>
<p>"The operating system has functions (APIs) that allow a program to acquire and/or release resources. If a resource is busy, then only the program that acquired it can work with it. If a resource is free, then any program can acquire it.</p>
<p>"Imagine that an office has shared coffee mugs. If someone takes a mug, then other people can no longer take it. But once the mug is used, washed, and put back in its place, then anyone can take it again."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Got it. It's like seats on the subway or other public transport. If a seat is free, then anyone can take it. If a seat is occupied, then it is controlled by the person who took it."</span></p>
<p>"That's right. And now let's talk about <span class="text-bold">acquiring external resources</span>. Every time your Java program starts working with a file on disk, the Java machine asks the operating system for exclusive access to it. If the resource is free, then the Java machine acquires it.</p>
<p>"But after you've finished working with the file, this resource (file) must be released, i.e. you need to notify the operating system that you no longer need it. <span class="text-viola">If you do not do this, then the resource will continue to be held by your program."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That sounds fair."</span></p>
<p>"To keep it that way, the operating system maintains a list of resources occupied by each running program. If your program exceeds the assigned resource limit, then the operating system will no longer give you new resources.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"It's like programs that can eat up all the memory..."</span></p>
<p>"Something like that. The good news is that if your program terminates, all resources are automatically released (the operating system itself does this)."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"If that's the good news, does that mean there is bad news?"</span></p>
<p>"Precisely so. The bad news is that if you are writing a server application..."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But do I write such applications?"</span></p>
<p>"A lot of server applications are written in Java, so most likely you will write them for work. As I was saying, if you are writing a server application, then your server needs to run non-stop for days, weeks, months, etc."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"In other words, the program doesn't terminate, and that means the memory is not automatically released."</span></p>
<p>"Exactly. And if you open 100 files a day and don't close them, then in a couple of weeks your application will reach its resource limit and crash."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's falling far short of months of stable work! What can be done?"</span></p>
<p>"Classes that use external resources have a special method for releasing them: <code>close()</code>.</p>
<p>"Here's an example of a program that writes something to a file and then closes the file when it is done, i.e. it frees up the operating system's resources. It looks roughly like this:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Code</th>
        <th>Note</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>String <span class="text-green">path</span> = "c:\\projects\\log.txt";
<span>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
</span><span><span class="text-user">output</span></span>.write(1);
<span><span class="text-user">output</span></span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>The path to the file.<br>
            Get the file object: acquire the resource.<br>
            Write to the file<br>
            Close the file - release the resource</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><span class="text-user">"Ah... So, after working with a file (or other external resources), I have to call the <code>close()</code> method on the object linked to the external resource."</span></p>
<p>"Yes. It all seems simple. But exceptions can occur as a program runs, and the external resource won't be released."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"And that is very bad. What to do?"</span></p>
<p>"To ensure that the <code>close()</code> method is always called, we need to wrap our code in a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>-<code>finally</code> block and add the <code>close()</code> method to the <code>finally</code> block. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>try
{
   FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(path);
   output.write(1);
   output.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm... Something is wrong here?"</span></p>
<p>"Right. This code will not compile, because the <code>output</code> variable is declared inside the <code>try{}</code> block, and therefore is not visible in the <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>Let's fix it:</p>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(path);

try
{
   output.write(1);
   output.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"Is everything okay now?"</span></p>
<p>"It's okay, but it won't work if an error occurs when we create the <code>FileOutputStream</code> object, and this could happen quite easily.</p>
<p>Let's fix it:</p>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.close();
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"And does everything work now?"</span></p>
<p>"There are still a few criticisms. First, if an error occurs when creating the <code>FileOutputStream</code> object, then the <code>output</code> variable will be null. This possibility must be accounted for in the <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>"Second, the <code>close()</code> method is always called in the <code>finally</code> block, which means that it is not necessary in the <code>try</code> block. The final code will look like this:</p>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>FileOutputStream <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span> = new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}
catch (IOException e)
{
   e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
   if (<span class="text-user">output</span>!=null)
      <span class="text-user">output</span>.<span class="text-red">close</span>();
}</code></pre>
<p>"Even if we don't consider the <code>catch</code> block, which can be omitted, then our 3 lines of code become 10. But we basically just opened the file and wrote 1."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Phew... It's a good thing that concludes the matter. Relatively understandable, but somewhat tedious, isn't it?"</span></p>
<p>"So it is. That's why Java's creators helped us by adding some syntactic sugar. Now let's move on to the highlight of the program, or rather, this lesson:</p>
<h2><code>try</code>-with-resources</h2>
<p>"Starting with its 7th version, Java has a new <code>try</code>-with-resources statement.</p>
<p>"It was created precisely to solve the problem with the mandatory call to the <code>close()</code> method."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"It sounds promising!"</span></p>
<p>"The general case looks quite simple:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
<pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-red">try</span> (<span class="text-viola">ClassName</span> <span class="code text-user">name</span> = new <span class="text-viola">ClassName</span>())
{
   <span class="code code--demo">Code that works with the <span class="text-lowercase text-user code">name</span> variable</span>
}</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span class="text-user">"So this is another variation of the <code>try</code> <span class="term">statement</span>?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. You need to add parentheses after the <code>try</code> keyword, and then create objects with external resources inside the parentheses. For each object in the parentheses, the compiler adds a <code>finally</code> section and a call to the <code>close()</code> method.</p>
<p>"Below are two equivalent examples:</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>Long code</th>
        <th>Code with try-with-resources</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code><span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span> <span class="text-user">output</span> = null;

try
{
   <span class="text-user">output </span>= new FileOutputStream(path);
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}
finally
{
   if (output!=null)
  <span class="text-user"> output</span>.close();
}</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>
<pre class="lecture-code language-java line-numbers"><code>try(<span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span> output = new <span class="text-red">FileOutputStream</span>(path))
{
   <span class="text-user">output</span>.write(1);
}</code></pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><span class="text-user">"Cool! The code using <code>try</code>-with-resources is much shorter and easier to read. And the less code we have, the less chance of making a typo or other error."</span></p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it. By the way, we can add <code>catch</code> and <code>finally</code> blocks to the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement. Or you can not add them if they aren't needed.</p>

<h2>Several variables at the same time</h2>
<p>"You may often encounter a situation when you need to open several files at the same time. Let's say you are copying a file, so you need two objects: the file from which you are copying data and the file to which you are copying data.</p>
<p>"In this case, the <code>try</code>-with-resources statement lets you create one but several objects in it. The code that creates the objects must be separated by semicolons. Here's the general appearance of this statement:</p>
<div class="lesson-example lesson-example--center">
<pre class="lecture-code lecture-code--present-sm language-java"><code><span class="text-red">try</span> (<span class="text-viola">ClassName</span> <span class="code text-user">name</span> = new <span class="text-viola">ClassName</span>(); <span class="text-orange">ClassName2</span> <span class="code text-user">name2</span> = new <span class="text-orange">ClassName2</span>())
{
   <span class="code code--demo">Code that works with the <span class="text-lowercase code text-user">name</span> and <span class="text-lowercase code text-user">name2</span> variables</span>
}</code></pre>
</div>
