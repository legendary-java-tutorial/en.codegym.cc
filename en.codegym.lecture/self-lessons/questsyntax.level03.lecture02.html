Connecting IntelliJ IDEA
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
An integrated development environment (IDE) saves programmers' time and makes their work much more convenient. A cool IDE is like a comfy chair: you won't even want to leave work. In this lesson, you'll learn how to connect the CodeGym plug-in to IntelliJ IDEA and complete tasks directly in this environment.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"I'd like to tell you how to do your homework with IntelliJ IDEA. I'm sure you'll soon appreciate how powerful it is. For starters, let's stick to the following procedure."</p>
<h2>Installing the Plugin</h2>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 1.</strong></span> Click the '<a href="/downloads/ide/plugin.jar">Download plugin</a>' link.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 2.</strong></span> Run IntelliJ IDEA. Go to File -> Settings, and find Plugins. For MacOS, click IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences -> Plugins.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 3.</strong></span> Click on the gear and select 'Install plugins from disk'</p>

<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 4.</strong></span> Open the folder where you downloaded the plugin (CodeGymIdeaPlugin.jar). Select the plugin, and click OK.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 5.</strong></span> Restart IntelliJ IDEA (Restart IntelliJ IDEA -> Apply -> OK -> Restart)</p>
<p>You've successfully installed the CodeGym plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
<h2>Working with the Plugin</h2>
<p>"After IDEA restarts, you will see a new group of six buttons. These buttons are what you will work with. Here's what you need to do.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 1.</strong></span> Open the list of available tasks by pressing the following button:</p>
<a href='https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/9fe624da-c868-495b-8a50-ec26c1ec8bdf/original.jpeg' alt+""  target='_blank'><img data-id="9fe624da-c868-495b-8a50-ec26c1ec8bdf" data-max-width="583" alt="Connecting IntelliJ IDEA - 2" src="https://cdn.codegym.cc/images/article/9fe624da-c868-495b-8a50-ec26c1ec8bdf/original.jpeg"></a>
<p>If this is the first time you've done this, a 'New Project' window will pop up. In this case, you are prompted to load the CodeGymTasks project.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 2.</strong></span> Select the folder where you will store your project. You will then see short explanations about the six buttons.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 3.</strong></span> Now you can see the list of available tasks. If it's empty, then it's time to move on with the course: you've already completed all the tasks in this stage.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 4.</strong></span> Select an available task from the list and click OK.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 5.</strong></span> A window with two tabs pops up. One contains the task conditions, and the other tab (Solution) is where you enter your code. That's it! Now you're ready to start working on the task.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 6.</strong></span> Enter your solution.</p>
<p><span class="label label-warning text-uppercase"><strong>Step 7.</strong></span> Now you can submit the task to your mentor for verification. Click the checkmark button:"</p>

<p>"You'll get help."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I think I get it. It almost works the same as the Web IDE."</span><br />
"Absolutely. Have fun with it. And if you still missed something, here's a video on how to install and work with the plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You must choose the JDK version in the project settings.</p>
<p>First go to File -> Project Structure, then Project Settings -> Project. In the 'Project language level' section choose '8 - Lambdas, type annotations etc.'

<h2>Addition: If you have Linux</h2>
<p>"Some students, mainly Linux users, install OpenJDK 8 instead of Oracle JDK 8. Since Open JDK 8 doesn't have a built-in JavaFX library, the CodeGym plugin for IntelliJ IDEA won't be able to work correctly."</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1:</strong></p>
<p>Install Oracle JDK 8 instead of OpenJDK 8</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong></p>
<p>Install Open JavaFX with a command like this:</p>
<pre data-line="" data-start="" class="line-numbers language-java"><code>sudo apt-get install openjfx</code></pre>
