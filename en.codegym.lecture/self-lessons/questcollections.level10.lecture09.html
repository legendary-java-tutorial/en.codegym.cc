<p><span class="text-user">"The 'correct' calendar? Does that mean there are several?"</span></p>
<p>"Yep. Well, it would be more accurate to say 'relevant'. The fact is that Earth has not one, but many calendars. Almost every one of them is associated with some religion or country."</p>
<p>"The year may be different depending on what country you are in."</p>
<p>"Here are examples of the most common calendars."</p>

<p>"Sometimes you really only need to get a piece of the available information. For example, the current year or day of the week."</p>
<p>"But sometimes you simply need to display the date in the right format."</p>
<p>"For example, in the log file or somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Or make a format that the user can customize. What do you do then?"</p>
<p>"There are special classes for this, too. The <span class="text-red"><strong>SimpleDateFormat</strong></span> class is perfectly suited for the task you described:"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"Ah. I remember. You already explained some about <span class="text-red"><strong>SimpleDateFormat</strong></span> to me, but I honestly don't remember much."</span></p>
<p>"It's all very simple. You create a <span class="text-red">SimpleDateFormat</span> object and pass it the date pattern you want to get. Then you call the format method, and it gives you the passed date in the desired form."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Sounds interesting. I'd like more details."</span></p>
<p>"Here you go. The details. Here are some of the letters that can be used in the date pattern:"</p>
