Additional lessons for Level
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
In this level, you became familiar with the int (integers) and String (text) types, and you delved into the operations you can perform on them. What's more, you learned how to work with data input. To consolidate this knowledge, you need to complete tasks, of course. But some "reading at home" also won't hurt. Here are some...

<p>In this level, you became familiar with the int (integers) and String (text) types, and you delved into the operations you can perform on them. What's more, you learned how to work with data input.</p>
<p>To consolidate this knowledge, you need to complete tasks, of course. But some "reading at home" also won't hurt. Here are some lectures to help you delve deeper into the topics we've covered.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/5-scanner-class" target="_blank">Scanner class</a></h2>
<p>As you already know, this class makes life a little easier for Java developers who get confused by reader classes. It can do a lot, and you've already managed to use it a couple of times. And if you haven't already done so, read the article "Scanner class", study the examples, and try to use the class yourself.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/4-reading-from-keyboard" target="_blank">Reading from the keyboard: "readers"</a></h2>
<p>This topic is not always presented to beginners at the outset, because the abundance of incomprehensible words can create confusion. This lesson on reading input from the keyboard provides a little more information than in the course itself. For example, you can learn about what a stream is â€” an entity you will meet a little later.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/java-operators" target="_blank">Numeric operators in Java</a></h2>
<p>Programming involves many operations on numbers. We'll consider the most important of them and provide examples. How do we perform operations on numbers in Java? There are various ways. There are ordinary arithmetic operations. There are the somewhat less familiar logical operations. And there are bitwise operations, which are completely exotic for non-IT people. It's time to dive into this as well as into operator precedence in our favorite language.</p>
