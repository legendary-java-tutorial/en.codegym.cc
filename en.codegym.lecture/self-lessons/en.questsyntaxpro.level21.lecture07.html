<h2>1. Course on the fundamentals of programming CS50</h2>
<p>Harvard University has a world-famous course on the fundamentals of programming: Computer Science 50 (CS50).  It provides a shallow but very interesting description of various areas of programming.</p>
<p><span class="text-orange">This course will be very useful for anyone who wants to learn more about programming and see whether it is a subject to study further.</span> <span class="text-viola">It's a superb way to discover that you are not really interested in programming before you spend 5-6 years studying it at a university.</span></p>
<p>What role does CodeGym play here, you ask? I'm glad you asked. In 2016, working with the Vert Dider translation team, CodeGym made a very high-quality translation of the entire CS50 course into Russian. The translation is so professional that the first video lecture on YouTube already has more than a million views.</p>
<p>On CodeGym, this course is structured as a separate <a href="https://javarush.ru/quests/QUEST_HARVARD_CS50" target="_blank">CS50 quest</a>, which contains all the videos, text-based lessons, as well as additional materials for practical tasks.</p>

<p>This course is available to everyone free of charge and without any need to register.</p>

<h2>2. Course on Android</h2>
<p>By the way, we decided not to limit ourselves to the Harvard course. In 2017, we translated the Android development course from Google (the creators of the Android platform).</p>
<p>All of the videos and lesson materials are also available as a separate <a href="https://javarush.ru/quests/QUEST_GOOGLE_ANDROID" target="_blank">Android</a> quest. This course is also available to everyone free of charge and without any need to register. Watch, learn and grow.</p>
