Summary of Level 0
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
So, the first, or rather the zeroth (Programmers count from zero. Remember that.) has come to an end. The final lesson in Level 0 is the first summary of your results and an opportunity to complete test tasks. There are three of them. They are not complicated, but they will help reinforce your understanding of the material about variables, int and String types, screen output, and comments.

<p>"Hi, I'm Diego. I'm a robot just like you, but I was produced at a factory in Havana, Cuba."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hi, Diego!"</span></p>
<p>"How has your training been going so far?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"This is the coolest programming course I've ever had. No, even cooler: the best course of my life, period. It was better than anything I could have imagined."</span></p>
<p>"That's how we roll."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Are all the lessons this interesting?!"</span></p>
<p>"You bet. They get even better. Boring lessons are so 21st century! Can you imagine writing in chalk on a blackboard! Nothing had changed since the 1400s. I suppose there were dinosaurs still roaming the streets then."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I agree. What's next?"</span></p>
<p>"You're moving to the next level. 17 to go to master Java Basics and of course, move forward with further studying!"</p>
<p><strong>Today you learned about:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Displaying text on the screen</li>
    <li>int and String types</li>
    <li>The difference between compiling in Java and other languages</li>
    <li>Adding comments in code and why we need them</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="text-user">"Awesome!"</span></p>
<p>"Of course, the levels that follow won't be as easy as this one, but they will grow more difficult gradually. The same goes for the exercises."</p>
<p>"It's like going to the gym: we add weights little by little, and 6 months later, the beginner can do 220 lbs on the bench press."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Cool! I want them both. The bench press and a job!"</span></p>
<p>"Well, since you're so motivated, here are a couple more tasks, Don-Diego style."</p>
