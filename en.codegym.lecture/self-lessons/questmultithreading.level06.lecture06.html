<p>"Hi, Amigo!"</p>
<p>"In my previous lessons, I sometimes used the words 'mutex' and 'monitor', now it's time to tell you what they mean."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm all ears."</span></p>
<p>"A <strong>mutex</strong> is a special object for synchronizing threads/processes. It has two possible states: busy and free. Simplying things, a mutex is a boolean variable that can have two values: busy (true) and free (false)."</p>
<p>"When a thread wants to take ownership of an object, it marks the object's mutex as busy. And when it is finished working with the object, it marks its mutex as free."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"In other words, a mutex is like a 'busy/free' sign on the door?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. And such a mutex is associated with every object in Java. Only the Java machine has direct access to the mutex. It is hidden from the programmer."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"How do we use it then?"</span></p>
<p>"In Java, we can work with a mutex through a monitor."</p>
<p>"A monitor is a special mechanism (piece of code) layered on top of a mutex. It guarantees proper interaction with the mutex. It's not enough to mark an object as busy. It's still necessary to ensure that other threads don't try to use the busy object."</p>
<p>"In Java, monitors are implemented using the keyword synchronized."</p>
<p>"When you write a synchronized block, the Java compiler replaces it with three pieces of code:"</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> At the beginning of the synchronized block, code is added that marks the mutex as busy.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> At the end of the synchronized block, code is added that marks the mutex as free.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Before the synchronized block, code is added which, if the mutex is busy, causes the thread to wait until the mutex is released.</p>
<p>"Here's roughly how it works:"</p>

<p>"In reality, the logic there is different and more complicated. But these are just details."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Can I have the details?"</span></p>
<p>"Until you learn how to use it properly, there's no point in getting tangled up in the details."</p>
<p>"A couple of levels back I gave you a list of all thread states with transition arrows and a list of methods that affect this state. Do you remember much?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Not really. I just forget everything so quickly…"</span></p>
<p>"The less practice you do, the less you benefit from the theory."</p>
<p>"By Level 40, you'll learn how to use all of this, and I'll explain how all this actually works. In the meantime, just learn to use it all properly. Got it?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, thank you, Ellie."</span></p>
