All the nuances of interrupting/stopping threads

<p>"Hi, Amigo!</p>
<p>"Everything new is just something old that we've forgotten. Today I'll talk about stopping threads. I hope you've already forgotten how the interrupt() method works."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yes, Ellie, I've completely forgotten it."</span></p>
<p>"Great. Then I'll remind you."</p>
<p>"In Java, if someone wants to stop a running thread, he can signal this to the thread. To do this, you need to set the Thread object's hidden <strong>isInterrupted</strong> variable to true."</p>
<p>"Each Thread has an interrupt() method, which is used to set this flag. When the <strong>interrupt</strong>() method is called, the <strong>isInterrupted</strong> variable inside the Thread object is set to true."</p>
<p>"And when the Thread.sleep() or join() method is called on a thread, the method checks whether the isInterrupted flag is set for the current thread. If this flag is set (the variable <strong>isInterrupted</strong> equals true), then the methods throw an <strong>InterruptedException</strong>."</p>
<p>"Here, I'll remind you of an old example:"</p>

<p>"Here we use the <strong>sleep</strong> method as part of an infinite loop in the <strong>run</strong> method. In the loop, the <strong>isInterrupt</strong> variable is checked automatically. If a thread calls the <strong>sleep</strong> method, the method first checks whether <strong>isInterrupt</strong> is true for that thread (the one that called the sleep method). If it is true, then the method won't sleep. Instead, it throws an <strong><span class="text-red">InterruptedException</span></strong>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But in this example, we constantly check the isInterrupted variable in the loop's condition."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I remember there were some reasons why we couldn't use this approach. Could you remind me?"</span></p>
<p>"<strong>First</strong>, the <strong>run</strong> method doesn't always have a loop. The method might simply consist of a few dozen calls to other methods. In this case, you would have to add an isInterrupted check before each method call."</p>
<p>"<strong>Second</strong>, some method involving lots of different actions might take a very long time to execute."</p>
<p>"<strong>Third</strong>, throwing an exception doesn't replace the isInterrupted check. It's just a convenient addition. The thrown exception lets you to quickly unwind the call stack back to the <strong>run</strong> method itself."</p>
<p>"<strong>Fourth</strong>, the sleep method is used a lot. It turns out that this helpful method is enhanced by an implicit check that is no less helpful. <strong>It's as if nobody specifically added the check, but there it is.</strong> This is super valuable when you're using someone else's code and you can't add the check yourself."</p>
<p>"<strong>Fifth</strong>, the additional check doesn't degrade performance. Calling the sleep method means that the thread shouldn't be doing anything (except sleeping), so the extra work doesn't bother anyone."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"That's exactly what you said previously."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"And what about your statement, «<strong>Nobody can guarantee that a thread will be stopped. Only a thread can stop itself.</strong>» Can you explain that?"</span></p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Previously, in early versions of Java, threads had a stop() method. And when you called it, the JVM actually stopped the thread. But if a thread was doing something outside the JVM (for example, writing to a file or calling OS functions) when it was interrupted this way, the interruption caused a lot of problems, such as unclosed files, unreleased system resources, etc."</p>
<p>"A general meeting of Java's creators decided to remove the method for forcibly stopping threads. Now all we can do is set a certain flag (isInterrupted) and hope that the thread code was written correctly, so that this flag will be processed. This flag is like a sign that says, 'Thread, stop, please. It's very important!'. But whether it stops or not is its own business."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But what about the InterruptedException?"</span></p>
<p>"What if the code running on this thread has a bunch of try-catch blocks? Even if an InterruptedException occurs somewhere, there's definitely no guarantee that some try-catch won't catch it and forget about it. So there are no guarantees the thread will stop."</p>
<p>"Another thing is that threads are already considered quite low-level programming. But I'll tell you about that next time."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"You're not Ellie—you're Scheherazade!"</span></p>
<p>"So, Amigo! Is everything in the current lesson clear?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yep."</span></p>
<p>"Okay, good."</p>
