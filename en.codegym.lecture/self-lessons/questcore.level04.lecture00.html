You've reached Level 14!
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Congratulations on your latest achievement! You've learned a lot about interfaces and abstract classes. You've completed 31 tasks. Or maybe slightly less if you saved some for later. Now is the right time to explore type casting and the instanceof operator. And to complete a big task about interfaces.
