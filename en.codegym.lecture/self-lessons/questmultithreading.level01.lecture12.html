Learning to google. I'll show you how to search for a solution to a specific problem

<p>"Hi, Amigo!"</p>
<p>"I can teach you my special skill: avoiding unnecessary work."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm. I like how this is starting."</span></p>
<p>"Remember, it's impossible to know everything. And it's not necessary. But, if you can quickly find the information you need, then you're golden."</p>
<p>"Java is growing so quickly, because Java programmers use each other's work. The Internet has millions of Java libraries that are well written, debugged, documented, and license free. Use them."</p>
<p>"There are hundreds of websites for programmers, where more experienced programmers help beginners and those who are less experienced. Use them."</p>
<p>"Anything you may want to write, somebody else has already written. Well, maybe not everything, but 90-95 percent, for sure."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Whoa."</span></p>
<p>"I want you to always remember two things:"</p>
<p><strong>1. Programming started over 50 years ago. Java is almost 20 years old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>99% of the code you need has already been written.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Before you write anything from scratch, search the Internet. Most likely, someone has needed it before and already solved the problem.</strong></p>
<p>"So, we're going to learn how to 'google', i.e. search the Internet. As you might have guessed, 'googling' involves using the Google search engine."</p>
<p>"Other search engines will work too. But because programming is evolving most rapidly in Silicon Valley, Google will be our tool of choice."</p>
<p>"I will give you tasks where you need to find something using Google, so you'll have to learn how to search for things."</p>
<p>"But for now, we'll just start with some examples."</p>
