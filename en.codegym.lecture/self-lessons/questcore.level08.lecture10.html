The making of Skyrim
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
We have this tradition at CodeGym: near the end of the level, your teacher Julio invites you to watch an interesting and fascinating IT video. Sit back and relax. You'll learn a lot of new stuff, and even get some dark matter for it... This time the video is about Skyrim.
