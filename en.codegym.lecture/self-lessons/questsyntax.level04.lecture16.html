Tasks with and without asterisks 
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Complete 4 tasks and get a pass to Level 5... Actually, that's not quite right. But in any case, the more tasks you complete, the more rapid and obvious will be your progress. Your attention, please: These tasks involve a solution in IntelliJ IDEA. Data input, branching, methods, and loops â€” we're putting into practice what we've already covered.
