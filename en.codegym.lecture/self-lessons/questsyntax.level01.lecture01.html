Introducing the program
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
The first level. It sounds not very cool, but if you consider the fact that programmers count from zero, it means you've got your first level-up as a CodeGym student. This lecture will not only give you a serving of entirely new information about the structure of a Java program, but also systematize and deepen your knowledge. We'll do this often. It's effective!
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hello, my young friend. I hope you haven't forgotten that I'm a 16th generation bureaucrat. If I hadn't systematized all my knowledge, I would never have achieved what I have. I'm full of useful information. I'm going to help you with some tasks. For starters, let me tell you about a typical
    Java program."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm listening."</span></p>
<p>"Fact number one. <span class="text-green">A Java program consists of classes.</span> Each class is stored in an individual file, whose name coincides with the class name. The file extension is <em><strong>java</strong></em>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So, a program consists of a series of files with the 'java' file extension, and each file contains code for just one class, right?</span>"</p>
<p>"Absolutely correct, Amigo. If a file is called MyCat.java, it contains the MyCat class."</p>
<p>"Fact number two. <span class="text-green">When we have many class files, we group them into folders and subfolders. Additionally, classes are grouped into packages and sub-packages.</span> <span class="text-corporate">The names of packages and sub-packages must be indicated in class code, and they must be identical to the folder and subfolder names on the drive.</span>"</p>
<p>"Thus, on the one hand, we have files stored in folders, and on the other – classes stored in packages. A class name must also coincide with the name of the file describing the class. The package name coincides with the name of the folder where the class is stored."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Can you give me any more details?"</span></p>
<p>"The names of the nested packages are divided by periods, almost like URLs."</p>
<p>"In other words, suppose you have a class named Cat, stored in an <strong>animals.pets</strong> package. That means:</p>
<p>The hard drive has some folder (we'll call it <strong>src</strong>) where all the project files are stored.</p>
<p>It contains a folder named <strong>animals</strong>, which in turn contains <strong>a pets</strong> subfolder.</p>
<p><strong>The pets</strong> folder contains a <strong>Cat</strong>.java file, which in turn contains code for the <strong>Cat</strong> class."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I'm not quite sure I understand."</span></p>
<p>"Look. The structure of the classes and packages mirrors the structure of folders and files on the drive. If we have a file named <span class="text-red">House</span>.java, stored in the src<strong>/com/houses</strong> folder, then there is a class named <span class="text-red">House</span>, stored in the <span class="text-red">com.houses</span> package."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Got it."</span></p>
<p>"You seem to be picking this up rather quickly. Look at the screen. This is code for a small class. I've labeled all the key parts:"</p>
