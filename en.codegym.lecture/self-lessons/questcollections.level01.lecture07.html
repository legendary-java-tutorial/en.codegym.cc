Reader, Writer
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
"Hi, Amigo, once again." "Hello to you, Rishi. What will today's lesson be about?" "Today I'm going to tell you about Reader and Writer." "But, Rishi, I'm already know almost everything about them!" "Repetition is the mother of learning." "Hmm. Well, okay." "Reader and Writer are analogs to InputStream and OutputStream, but they work with characters, not bytes. Sometimes they are also called character streams, as opposed to InputStream ..."

<p><span class="text-user">"Hello to you, Rishi. What will today's lesson be about?"</span></p>

<p><span class="text-user">"But, Rishi, I already know almost everything about them!"</span></p>
<p>"Repetition is the mother of learning."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm. Well, okay."</span></p>
<p>"<strong>Reader</strong> and <strong>Writer</strong> are analogs to <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong>, but they work with characters, not bytes. Sometimes they are also called character streams, as opposed to <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong>, which are called byte streams."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"One is for characters, the other is for bytes. I remember."</span></p>
<p>"It's not just that. These classes are specially designed to work with text and strings. Today we will look at two classic implementations of these abstract classes: <strong>FileReader</strong> and <strong>FileWriter</strong>."</p>
<p>"Here are the methods of the <strong>FileReader</strong> class:"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"I know that!"</span></p>
<p>"That's wonderful. Then let's look at one interesting example, and later Diego will give you more tasks."</p>
<p>"How do you read a file line by line? Can you write the code?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Easy, look:"</span></p>
<div class="code-heading">Code</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>// Create a list for storing the lines
List<strong>&lt;String&gt;</strong> list = new ArrayList<strong>&lt;String&gt;()</strong>;

// Open the file
File <span class="text-green">file</span> = new File("<span class="text-green">c:/document.txt</span>");
BufferedReader <span class="text-red">reader</span> = new BufferedReader(new <span class="text-corporate">FileReader</span>(file));

// As long as the file isn't empty, read from it
while (<span class="text-red">reader</span>.ready())
{
 list.add(<span class="text-red">reader</span>.readLine());
}

// Close the file
reader.close();</code></pre>
<p>"Hmm. Not bad."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Not bad? It's all simple and beautiful. Admit it, Rishi—I already have an excellent mastery of I/O threads. So what could be improved here?"</span></p>
<p>"Well, for example, you could do this:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Rishi's code</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>File <span class="text-green">file</span> = new File("<span class="text-green">c:/document.txt</span>");

List list = Files.<span class="text-red">readAllLines</span>(<span class="text-green">file</span>.toPath(), <span class="text-user">Charset.defaultCharset(</span>));</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm. That is shorter. And just today you told me about all these methods. I'll rework it. Thank you for the lesson, Rishi."</span></p>
<p>"Good luck, Amigo."</p>
