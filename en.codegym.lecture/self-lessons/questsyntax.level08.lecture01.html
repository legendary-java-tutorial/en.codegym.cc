<p>"Hi, Amigo. I'd like to tell you about collections today. <span class="text-green">In Java, a collection/container means a class whose main purpose is to store a collection of other elements.</span> You already know one such class: ArrayList."</p>
<p>"In Java, collections are divided into three main groups: Set, List, Map."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What is the difference between them?"</span></p>
<p><span class="text-corporate">"Let me start with Set. Imagine many shoes thrown into a pile. This is a Set. You can add an element to a Set, search for it, or delete it. The important thing to note is that the set elements don't have a specific assigned order."</span></p>

<p><span class="text-user">"That's not much to go on…"</span></p>
<p><span class="text-viola">"Now imagine the same pile of shoes arranged neatly along the wall. Now there is order. Each element has its own number. You could simply grab Pair No. 4 based on its number (index). This is a List.</span> You can add an element to the beginning or the middle of a list, or remove an element – simply by using its index."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"I see. What about a Map?"</span></p>
<p>"Imagine the same shoes, but now each pair has a note with a name: 'Nick', 'Vic' or 'Anna'. This is a Map (also often called a dictionary). <span class="text-red">Each element has its own unique name which is used to address it. This unique name for each element is often called a 'key'. Thus, a Map is a set of key-value pairs.</span> The key doesn't have to be a string: it can be any type. A <strong>Map</strong> whose keys are <strong>Integer</strong> is in fact a <strong>List</strong> (with some differences)."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"I more or less understand, but I'd like to see more examples."</span></p>
<p>"Rishi will give you examples, but I'd like to add a few words."</p>
<p>"Immediately after being created, collections and containers don't store anything, but you can add elements into them one by one. And if you do, their size will change dynamically."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Now that's interesting. How do I know how many elements a collection contains?"</span></p>
<p>"You have the size() method for that. Collections have everything you might need. I believe that after a few more lessons you'll see for yourself just how convenient collections are."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I hope so, Ellie."</span></p>
