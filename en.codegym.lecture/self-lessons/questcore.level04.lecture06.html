Bonus task | Lesson 6 | Level 4
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Welcome to the international chicken farm! What? Nothing is ready! Then our plans have changed. Since it's not already here, we'll create the chicken farm. It will accommodate chickens of different nationalities, derived from some abstract Hen class, with methods that will return the number of eggs laid per month.

<p>"What? You figured that out already?! You can't just go and complete all my tasks. It seems to me that you're just fooling around. Here's a new task for you. It's very difficult. Pay attention and arrange everything systematically. Read the literature, and ask your friends! Nobody dares deceive the Great Diego!"</p>
