Practice from Diego
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Nothing can replace programming practice, even if you read all the books in the world. In other words, completing an extra task will never be extra. In this hands-on lesson, we'll learn to make changes in someone else's code. Of course, it would be good to not break our program in the process: it must compile.

<p>"The less you listen to those meatsacks, the better. <strong>Can anything really replace practice? </strong>You’re not going to learn how to swim while sitting at a desk, or are you? Ha-ha! <span class="text-red">Practice is everything for us.</span> We’re robots, after all!"</p>
