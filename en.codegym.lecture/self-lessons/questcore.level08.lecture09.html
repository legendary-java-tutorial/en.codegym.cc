Useful links from the Professor — 18
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Of course, looking at the same material from different angles is useful, because everyone thinks differently, and perhaps for you the best source of the theory will be different from the source best suited to your friend. Especially for you, the Professor found a very interesting lesson online that will teach you a lot more about input/output streams.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>"Hi, Amigo! As always, I have some theory to teach you that will help you better understand the topic. Are you ready?"</p>
<p><big><strong>Input/output in Java. FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedInputStream classes</strong></big></p>
<p>There's no such thing as too much information about Java I/O (input and output streams in Java). You're already familiar with these concepts from past lessons. In <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/245-inputoutput-in-java-fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-and-bufferedinputstream-classes' target='_blank'>this article</a>, we'll consider the following 3 classes in detail: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedInputStream. We'll dive into some practical examples of when and how to use them. </p>
<p><big><strong>Why we need the PrintStream class</strong></big></p> 
<p>Are you familiar with the PrintStream class? Sure you are. Well, at the very least, one of its methods is println(), which you use daily. <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/246-why-we-need-the-printstream-class' target='_blank'>This article</a> will teach you what sort of class it is, what constructors it has, and what it can do besides output to the console. And as always, examples are inevitable.</p>
