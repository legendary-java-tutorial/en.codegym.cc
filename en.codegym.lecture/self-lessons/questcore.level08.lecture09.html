<p>"Hi, Amigo! As always, I have some theory to teach you that will help you better understand the topic. Are you ready?"</p>
<p><big><strong>Input/output in Java. FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedInputStream classes</strong></big></p>
<p>There's no such thing as too much information about Java I/O (input and output streams in Java). You're already familiar with these concepts from past lessons. In <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/245-inputoutput-in-java-fileinputstream-fileoutputstream-and-bufferedinputstream-classes' target='_blank'>this article</a>, we'll consider the following 3 classes in detail: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and BufferedInputStream. We'll dive into some practical examples of when and how to use them. </p>
<p><big><strong>Why we need the PrintStream class</strong></big></p> 
<p>Are you familiar with the PrintStream class? Sure you are. Well, at the very least, one of its methods is println(), which you use daily. <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/246-why-we-need-the-printstream-class' target='_blank'>This article</a> will teach you what sort of class it is, what constructors it has, and what it can do besides output to the console. And as always, examples are inevitable.</p>
