<p><em>Two students, who were obsessive gamers in their first and fifth years, made a bet whether it was possible to play while studying. After arguing for a long time, they finally decided to ask the dean. Certainly, he would know.</em><br />
    <em> "Can I play computer games all day long while preparing for the exams?" asked the first-year student.</em><br />

    <em> "Of course! You can always study!" replied the dean, praising him.</em></p>
