5-minute break.
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Here at the secret CodeGym training center even our breaks are lessons. See how advanced the training is! Nothing less than universal harmony and alternating periods of relaxation and concentration, just like the best practitioners advise! During your five-minute downtime, we'll tell jokes (on topic) or interesting stories from life.

<p><em>Two students, who were obsessive gamers in their first and fifth years, made a bet whether it was possible to play while studying. After arguing for a long time, they finally decided to ask the dean. Certainly, he would know.</em><br />
    <em> "Can I play computer games all day long while preparing for the exams?" asked the first-year student.</em><br />
    <em> "Nonsense! One can't play while studying!" scolded the dean indignantly.</em><br />
    <em> "Can I study while playing the computer?" asked the fifth-year student.</em><br />
    <em> "Of course! You can always study!" replied the dean, praising him.</em></p>
