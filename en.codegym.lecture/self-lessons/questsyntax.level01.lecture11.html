<p>"My turn. OK, listen."</p>
<p><em>Some scientists created a supercomputer. It was so powerful it was supposed to be able to answer any question. So, they ask their question:</em><br />
    <em>"Does God exist?"</em><br />
    <em> The computer starts thinking. After some buzzing and blinking lights, it says:</em><br />
    <em>"Not enough information. Connect me to the most powerful computers on the planet."</em><br />
    <em> The scientists scratch their heads and decide to humor it. Again, they ask:</em><br />
    <em>"Does God exist?"</em><br />
    <em> More buzzing and blinking lights, and the computer answers:</em><br />
    <em>"Not enough information. Connect me to all computers on Earth."</em><br />
    <em> This was a bit harder to do, but the scientists managed to connect it to all existing computers. Again, they asked their question. And again, the computer says:</em><br />
    <em> "Not enough information. Connect me to all networks, all computing devices, etc."</em><br />
    <em> The scientists went out of their way to grant these requests. Finally, they ask one more time:</em><br />
    <em>"Does God exist?"</em><br />
    <em> The answer:</em><br />
    <em>"He does now."</em></p>
