<p>When you first started learning Java, maybe you had no idea that you would be able to write simple programs and games so soon. We're sure that you now have a good understanding of how the CodeGym game engine works and, perhaps, you've already tried to write a game or two.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet found the time and are looking for inspiration or the right moment, here it is. In the time the <a href="https://codegym.cc/projects/games" target="_blank">games section</a> has existed, many students of varying skill level have managed to create their own versions of popular games.</p>
<p>The CodeGym team keeps track of students' successes, and from time to time, we share the most interesting game mods with the whole community. For example, here are <a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/2146-top-13-samihkh-krutihkh-modifikaciy-igr-na-javarush" target="_blank">our first picks</a> â€” 13 of the best games written by the "early birds". And here is our <a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/2459-luchshie-modifikacii-igr-na-javarush-vihpusk-2" target="_blank">second selection of students' games</a> that definitely deserve attention.</p>
<p>It is entirely possible that your name could end up among the best.</p>
