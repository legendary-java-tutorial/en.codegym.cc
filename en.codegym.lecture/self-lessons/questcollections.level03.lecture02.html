<p>"False alarm. Everything is fine with my relief valve."</p>
<p>"Let's continue. Today I want to explain what JSON is."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"Yeah, I've heard that word many times. What does it mean?"</span></p>
<p>"With the web's growth, HTML pages with JavaScript began to actively communicate with servers and download data from servers. To make this process easier, a standard was invented for communication between the server and a JavaScript program. This standard is called <strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</strong>."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So what is this standard?"</span></p>
<p>"Oh, that's the most interesting part. The declaration of a <strong>JavaScript</strong> object was chosen as the standard!"</p>
<p>"Here's an example of messages in JSON format:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Messages in JSON format</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-json" data-line="" data-start=""><code>{
 "name": "peter",
 "last": "jones"
}</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers language-json" data-line="" data-start=""><code>{
 "name": "batman",
 "enemies": [1,4,6,7,8,4,3,90]
}</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers language-json" data-line="" data-start=""><code>{
 "name": "grandpa",
 "children": [
<span class="text-green">{
 "name" = "Bob",
 "children": ["Emma", "Nikol"]
},</span>
{
 "name" = "Devid",
 "children": ["Jesica", "Pamela"]
}
]
}</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers language-json" data-line="" data-start=""><code>{
 <span class="text-red">"12 45":</span> {
 <span class="text-red">"__++"</span>: [],
 <span class="text-red">"1"</span>:"2"
 }
}</code></pre>
<pre class="line-numbers language-json" data-line="" data-start=""><code>{}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"So, these messages are simply passing data that actually just represents JavaScript objects?"</span></p>
<p>"Yep. And this is super convenient for two reasons:"</p>
<p>"First, there's no need to convert data from the 'delivery format' into a collection of JavaScript objects."</p>
<p>"Secondly, this format is very visual: it is easily read and edited by humans."</p>
<p>"Of course, there are some limitations: not everything can be represented as a collection of objects, arrays, text, and numbers."</p>
<p>"For example, a Date object is sent as a String: «2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z»"</p>
<p>"Even still, this method of sending information is extremely convenient, readable, rather lightweight, and contains a minimal amount of extra information. This helped it become very popular."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"In my opinion, JSON is a very simple format. Everything about it is obvious and clear."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"And JavaScript itself isn't very complicated."</span></p>
<p>"The language is simple, but programs written in it are complicated."</p>
<p>"Or, as my uncle used to say, human English has 26 letters, but learning to speak it properly is no easy task for a lobster."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm. You're right, Bilaabo. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the interesting lesson."</span></p>
