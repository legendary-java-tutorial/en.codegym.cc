<p>Sure it doesn’t mean you know everything about Java and Java development. You still have a lot of work to do. This is a good time to start your own small project or a couple of them and place them on github.

<p>Do not rush to immediately accept the first available proposal. Much better to go for 10 interviews. While you receive two or more offers, take the best of them and be sure to notify all HR-s about your decision. They remember that you are decent and keep your word, and this will give you advantages at your next meeting with this HR. They also change their jobs pretty often, so you can meet in another company. Now you do not work for them, but time will pass, and everything can change.</p>
<p>CodeGym’s team is happy for every student who has found the job through our course. So, it would be wonderful if you post your success story in our <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/stories' target='_blank'>society</a>.</p>
