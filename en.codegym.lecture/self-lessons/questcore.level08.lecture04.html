<p>"Hello, Amigo! Today we're going to once again dig into how <strong>InputStream</strong> and <strong>OutputStream</strong> work. The initial explanation was actually a little simplistic. These are not interfaces. They are abstract classes, and they even have a couple of implemented methods. Let's take a look at the methods they have:"</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th>InputStream methods</th>
        <th>What the method does</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>int <span class="text-red">read</span>(<span class="text-green">byte[]</span> <span class="text-user">buff</span>);</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>This method immediately reads a block of bytes into the <span class="text-user">buffer</span> (<span class="text-green">byte array</span>), until the <span class="text-user">buffer</span> is full or until the source doesn't have any more bytes to read.<br />
            The method returns the number of bytes actually read (which can be less than the length of the array)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>int <span class="text-red">read</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>This method reads one byte and returns it. The result is widened to an int for looks. If there are no more bytes to read, the method returns -1.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>int <span class="text-red">available</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>This method returns the number of unread (available) bytes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>void <span class="text-red">close</span>();</code></pre>
        </td>
        <td>This method «closes» the stream. You call this when you're done working with the stream.<br />
            The object then performs the housekeeping operations needed to close the file, etc.<br />
            At this point, you can't read any more data from the stream.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>

<p><span class="text-user">"So we can read not only single bytes, but also whole blocks?"</span></p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Can we also write whole blocks?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes, check it out:"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"What would the file copying code look like if we read whole blocks at a time instead of single bytes?"</span></p>
<p>"Hmm. Something like this:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Copy a file on disk</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
{
 //Create a stream to read bytes from a file
 <span class="text-green">FileInputStream<strong> inputStream</strong></span> = new <span class="text-green">FileInputStream</span>("c:/data.txt");
 //Create a stream to write bytes to a file
 <span class="text-user">FileOutputStream outputStream</span> = new <span class="text-user">FileOutputStream</span>("c:/result.txt");

  <span class="text-red">byte[] buffer = new byte[1000];</span>
 while (<span class="text-green">inputStream.<strong>available</strong>() &gt; 0</span>) //as long as there are unread bytes
 {
  //Read the next block of bytes into buffer, and store the actual number of bytes read in count.
  <span class="text-red">int count</span> = <span class="text-green">inputStream.<strong>read</strong></span>(<span class="text-red">buffer</span>);
  <span class="text-user">outputStream.<strong>write</strong></span>(<span class="text-red">buffer, 0, count</span>); //Write a block (part of a block) to the second stream
 }

 <span class="text-green">inputStream</span>.close(); //Close both streams. We don't need them any more.
 <span class="text-user">outputStream</span>.close();
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="text-user">"I understand everything about the buffer, but what's this count variable?"</span></p>
<p>"When we read the latest block of data from a file, we may get, say, 328 bytes instead of 1000. So when we write the data, we need to indicate that we're not writing the entire block—only the first 328 bytes."</p>
<p>When we read the last block, the <strong>read</strong> method will return the number of bytes actually read. 1000 every time we read a block, except for the last block, when we get 328.</p>
<p>So when we write a block, we indicate that not all of the bytes in the buffer should be written, just 328 (i.e. the value stored in the count variable).</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Now it's all clear. Thanks, Ellie."</span></p>
