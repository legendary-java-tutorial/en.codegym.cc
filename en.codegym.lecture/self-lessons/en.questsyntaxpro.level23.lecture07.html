<p>Now you know how classes are grouped together in Java and how they are imported. Congratulations! With each level, you gain a deeper understanding of how everything works in software development.</p>
<p>We devoted a lot of time to analyzing bitwise operators and to getting to know the Math and Random classes. Perhaps there are a few more points that should be added to the lesson materials. Below is your additional reading for today :)</p>
<h2><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/10-bitwise-operators" target="_blank">Java bitwise operators</a></h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, in this article you will learn more about bitwise operations. Don't be too lazy to read and master everything here. After all, bitwise operations form the entire foundation for how a computer works. And as a future programmer, you should definitely understand this well.</p>
<!---<h2><a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/1977-teorija-verojatnosti-na-praktike-ili-znaete-li-vih-pro-random" target="_blank">Probability theory in practice, i.e. do you know about Random?</a></h2>
<p>If you want to delve deeper into the Random class and pseudo-random numbers, this article will come in handy: it has examples and links to additional sources.</p>
<h2><a href="https://javarush.ru/groups/posts/2762-klass-java-math-i-ego-metodih" target="_blank">Math class</a></h2>
<p>This lesson will help you properly organize your knowledge about the Math class. You will learn which calculations this class can help with. And as always, there are real-world examples. Of course, it won't be possible to cover every method, but you will become familiar with the most important methods you will need in your work.</p>--->
