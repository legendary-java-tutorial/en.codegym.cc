Practice with instanceof
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
While you were studying the instanceof operator, the guys at the secret CodeGym center were having a great time at a party. A party held in your honor, by the way. As a result, your teacher Diego isn't really in the mood to work today. He's only prepared two tasks about instanceof for you. But don't get soft. You can make it up later.

<p>"Hello, Amigo! You're a great friend! The professor said to come up with 10 tasks, but I'll give you just two. That's the most I could think of with a hangover. It's a shame you missed the party held in your honor yesterday. It was a great time."</p>
