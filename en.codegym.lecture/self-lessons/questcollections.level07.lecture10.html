<p>"Hi, Amigo. Here's a useful task:"</p>
<div class="task-widget-container" showCover="true" taskKey="com.codegym.task.task37.task3706"></div>
<p>"I remembered! Here's the task I promised you last time. Do you know what a SET is?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I've know for a long time. And Rishi just told me about Collections utility class."</span></p>
<p>"SET stands for Super Extreme Task. What did Rishi tell you about it?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Uh, he told me about something else... about useful methods for collections."</span></p>
<p>"About something else?? Okay, go check the task conditions. Just don't solve this task on paper. I saw you writing something down there. You need to write directly to your memory card."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So where should I solve it?"</span></p>
<p>"Go see the secret agent. You'll find that he has something just for you."</p>
