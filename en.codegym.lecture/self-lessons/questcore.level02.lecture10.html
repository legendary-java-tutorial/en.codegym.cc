Useful links from the Professor — 12
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
You've probably already guessed that Professor Hans Noodles doesn't give bad advice! This time he's found a link to an excellent lesson about polymorphism and interfaces. It will help you add some structure to your knowledge, if you want to. Think you already know everything? Read this lesson and you'll understand how very wrong you are.

<p>"Well, hello, Amigo! Good news! I'm wrapping up work on a super accurate predictor!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Cool. What does it do? Will it predict when I'll become a cool programmer?"</span></p>
<p>"Hey, don't rush, my young robot! I didn't look that far ahead, but I already know that…"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"What?!"</p>
<p>"…I saw that you would come to me with questions about the topics you studied this week. So, I prepared additional materials for you in advance: they'll help you figure everything out."</p>
<p><big><strong>How to use polymorphism</strong></big></p>
<p>"Polymorphism's main advantage is flexibility. On the one hand, you can work with multiple data types as if they were the same type. On the other hand, you can still preserve objects' specialized behavior. When do you need to cast to a common type and when do you need specific characteristics? <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/99-how-to-use-polymorphism' target='_blank'>We'll talk about this</a>.</p>
<p><big><strong>How method overriding works</strong></big></p>
<p>You're already familiar with method overloading. It's time <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/100-how-method-overriding-works' target='_blank'>to learn about overriding classes</a>. This will help you when you need a common method to perform different actions depending on the class it is called in. Everything is possible! The important thing is to know how :)</p>
<p><big><strong>Why interfaces are necessary in Java</strong></big></p>
<p><a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/101-why-interfaces-are-necessary-in-java' target='_blank'>This lesson</a> provides a relaxed and detailed description of what interfaces are and why they appeared in the language. And you'll learn about popular Java interfaces. Prepare yourself! This topic has a sequel!</p>
<p><big><strong>Default methods in interfaces</strong></big></p>
<p>Every version of Java differs from those that came before. Version eight introduced the concept of default methods in interfaces. This lets you define default methods and implement them inside an interface. You'll find examples and explanations in <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/102-default-methods-in-interfaces' target='_blank'>this lesson</a>.</p>
<p><big><strong>Specific examples of abstract classes in Java</strong></big></p>
<p>You've become acquainted with abstract classes. You already know that they're like 'blanks' for your future classes. But do all methods of such a class have to be abstract? And why doesn't Java have multiple inheritance? Here's a 'tip' from my super accurate predictor: the material from <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/103-specific-examples-of-abstract-classes-in-java' target='_blank'>this lesson</a> will better prepare you for the next level.</p>
