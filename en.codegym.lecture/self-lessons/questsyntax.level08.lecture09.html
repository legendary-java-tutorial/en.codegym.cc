<p><span class="text-user">&#34;Amigo, Level-8 Java Developer, reporting for a lesson, sir!&#34;</span></p>
<p>&#34;Ah, Amigo, is that you? Greetings! Judging by the military rhetoric, you must be speaking with the Captain too much.&#34; </p>
<p><span class="text-user">&#34;Not at all, sir! I spoke a moderate amount with the captain! Here's my report: I have studied and partially understood the lesson on collections, and I've completed many tasks about collections, sir! But that's not all…&#34;</span></p>
<p>&#34;Partially, you say? Not all the way, you say? Well, here's five interesting lessons to help. I hope that everything will become much clearer after you've reviewed them.&#34;</p>
<p><big><strong>ArrayList in pictures</strong> </big></p>
<p>"If you don't quite understand how ArrayList works, <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/21-arraylist-in-pictures--' target='_blank'>this lesson</a> is for you. There will be a lot of pictures and explanations and almost no code. But most importantly, after you have read and assimilated it, you'll understand very well how ArrayList works... Who knows, maybe you'll even implement your own after that! So, this is a good task for a beginner developer to practice on."</p>
<p><big><strong>Collections class</strong></big></p>
<p>"There are tasks that the ArrayList is just perfect for. Java's creators implemented this functionality in a separate class, so that you and other developers don't have to provide your own implementation each time. <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/22-collections-class' target='_blank'>This article</a> will address these tasks and the Collection class."</p>
<p><big><strong>LinkedList</strong></big></p>
<p>"The Java programmer doesn't live by ArrayList alone. There are many other useful data structures. For example, a linked list (implemented in the LinkedList class). You've already formed first impressions about it, but haven't yet explored LinkedList's special features? Read <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/23-linkedlist' target='_blank'>the article</a>, and you'll get a much better understanding of how this data structure is organized and what its benefits are!"</p>
 <p><big><strong>HashMap: what kind of map is this?</strong></big></p>
<p>"And another one about a data structure you've heard something about in the lessons... What do you say? Did you already grasp everything about HashMap? If so, I'm happy for you (though you're most likely mistaken!). But if you feel doubtful, read <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/hashmap-java' target='_blank'>the article</a> and learn. It has many useful examples."</p>
<p><big><strong>How not to get lost in time: DateTime and Calendar</strong></big></p>
<p>"Hey, here's something new: <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/java-time-calendar' target='_blank'>some useful information</a> on how to be better at Java over time. Historically, Date was the first class for working with dates... Have you heard of it? You can use it, but it... uh... is a bit weird even for me... And it's deprecated (remember that word? If not, Google it fast). Later, more sophisticated tools appeared: DateTime and Calendar. I recommend that you study them!"</p>
<p>&#34;That's all for today. Not very many extra lessons this time, but they are all very useful and thorough. What the?! Hey, stop nodding off. Right face! Again, right face! March! Read!&#34;</p>
