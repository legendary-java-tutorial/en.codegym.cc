Additional tasks
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
There's no such thing as extra tasks in the study of programming! The professor at the secret CodeGym center is 1000% convinced of this. That's why several tasks must be completed at the end of the level. Some of them are more advanced and require student's to be able to google. Or think. Or think and google.
