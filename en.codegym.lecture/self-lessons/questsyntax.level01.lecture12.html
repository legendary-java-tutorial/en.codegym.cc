Nerd break
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
At the end of a level, it's helpful to unwind, watch an interesting video, and dream about your future. We suggest an excellent substitute for TV shows: videos about technology and famous nerds. During this break, you'll see Steve Jobs' famous speech to Stanford graduates. Let it inspire you to study with renewed intensity!
