<p><big><strong>What's the difference between a mutex, a monitor, and a semaphore?</strong></big></p>
<p>As you've progressed through the course, you've encountered the concepts of "mutex" and "monitor". These are related concepts, so without a hint it's not so easy to remember how they differ. Additionally, when you read lessons and watch videos about multithreading on other websites, you'll come across another similar concept: "semaphore". <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/220-whats-the-difference-between-a-mutex-a-monitor-and-a-semaphore" target="_blank">This lesson</a> will bring order to it all and you'll understand how they differ.</p>
<p><big><strong>Examples of reflection</strong></big></p>
<p><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/265-examples-of-reflection" target="_blank">This lesson</a> will teach you more about a Java standard library: the Java Reflection API. This is one of the language's powerful language, which, by the way, is recommended for experienced programmers. Let's find out what reflection can do and look at some practical examples.</p>
<p><big><strong>equals() and hashCode()</strong></big></p>
<p>We've talked about the equals() and hashCode() methods, starting in the early lessons of the CodeGym course. The time has come to return to them in order to <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/264-equals-and-hashcode-methods-best-practices" target="_blank">examine them in greater detail</a> with more complex examples. Believe me, we have something to talk about :)</p>
