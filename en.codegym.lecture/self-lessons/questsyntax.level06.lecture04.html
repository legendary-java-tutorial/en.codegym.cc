Object lifetime
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
It's time to philosophize about the life and death of objects! Programmers often create dozens and dozens of objects and store them in various lists, but they never clean up these lists. This causes bloating. To avoid this, you have to use objects correctly. You'll get your first introduction in lesson.

<p>"I'd also like to tell you a couple of interesting things about object lifetime. In Java, it's very difficult to accidentally destroy an object. <span class="text-green">If you have a reference to an object, it is alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-red">You can't change references to an object, and you can't increase or decrease them. Additionally, you can't create a reference to an object.</span> You can only assign a reference or set it to null."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I think I understand, Ellie. So if I erase (or set to null) all references to an object, then I'll never again be able to get a reference to that object or access it, right?"</span></p>
<p>"That's correct. However, you can also have the situation where the system has too many live objects that are not being used. <span class="text-viola">Programmers often create dozens of objects, store them in various lists for processing, and then never empty these lists.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-corporate">Objects that programmers don't need are usually simply marked as eligible for garbage collection.</span> Nobody deletes them from lists. As a result, large Java programs often become too big as more and more unused objects remain in memory.</p>
<p>You won't run into this soon, but every time I'll remind you about these unused objects, as well as the right way to dispose of them."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"OK. Thank you, Ellie, for helping me better understand references."</span></p>
