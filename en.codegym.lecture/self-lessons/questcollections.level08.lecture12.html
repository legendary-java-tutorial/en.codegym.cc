<p>"Hi, Amigo! Well, are you ready to get a little more knowledge? I hope you have a lot of free time, because today there will be many lessons."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Hmm, I don't... But wait... What are you going to tell me about?"</span></p>
<p>"Today is only preparation for the harsh reality of employment: we will consider questions asked during interviews, software development methodologies, and some other nuances."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Well, that's a completely different matter! I'm ready."</span></p>

<p>Software development is a complex business process. This means that IT professionals need to speak the language of optimization, planning, and costing.</p>
<p>An understanding of management concepts gives both employers and developers a big advantage and helps take collaboration to the next level.</p>
<p><big><strong><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/312-annotations-part-1--a-little-boring" target="_blank">Everything you need to know about annotations</a></strong></big></p>
<p>As you study, annotations may seem somewhat useless but necessary. You don't know why they exist or what they do. You've read a couple of articles that said, "it's so great that we have annotations now, everything has become so simple."</p>
<p>But if you don't know how things were before annotations and you don't understand the subject, then how can you understand what has become better? As a result, it will be useful for you to work with annotations using material written by an experienced programmer.</p>

<p>Let's talk about interview questions. About what you need to prepare for and what you need to know. This is a great time to review or to study these points for the first time.</p>
<p>You will find a huge, three-part selection of questions and answers about OOP, Java syntax, Java exceptions, collections, and multithreading.</p>
<p>It's difficult to cover everything at once, but this material will provide a good foundation for those preparing to find their first job as a programmer.</p>
