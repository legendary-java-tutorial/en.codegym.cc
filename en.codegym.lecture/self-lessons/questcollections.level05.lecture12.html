<p>In this lesson, we continue our study of generics. As it happens, this is a big topic, but there's no avoiding it — it's an extremely important part of the language :)</p>
<p><big><strong><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/290-type-erasure" target="_blank">Type erasure</a></strong></big></p>
<p>Here you will learn more about some of the features of generics and about working with them. As always, through practice.</p>
<p><big><strong><a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/292-wildcards-in-generics" target="_blank">Wildcards in generics</a></strong></big></p>
<p>Wildcards are a very important topic. So much so that we have dedicated a separate lesson to it! That said, there's nothing particularly complicated about wildcards. You'll see that right away.</p>
