<p>&#34;Well, hello, Amigo! I trust you understood everything that Ellie and Rishi told you today.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But even if you do, repeating and reinforcing class material never hurt anybody. These activities usually not only solidify your knowledge, but also expand your awareness!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But I'm getting carried away. Forget about what I just said. Instead, here are a few useful links that will help you to dive deeper into and review the material from the third level. They may even help you understand something that you didn't before.&#34;</p>
<p><big><strong>Reading from the keyboard with readers</strong></big></p>
<p>"This topic isn't that complicated, but it can be muddy. Beginners often find it confusing due to the abundance of incomprehensible words. If you misunderstood something or want to reinforce your knowledge, read <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/4-reading-from-keyboard' target='_blank'>this article</a>. It'll give a little boost to your understanding of reading from the keyboard. For example, by improving your understanding of what a stream is."</p>
<p><big><strong>Scanner class</strong></big></p> 
<p>"This class makes the life of Java developers (who can be confused by readers) somewhat easier. It knows how to do a lot, and you've probably already used it a couple of times. If not, read this article about the <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/5-scanner-class' target='_blank'>Scanner class</a> and give it a try. For a change."</p>
<p><big><strong>Escaping characters</strong></big></p>
 <p>"You'll gradually remember how to escape characters, even if you currently think the process has too many rules. So it doesn't hurt to read something on the topic. For example, here's a useful article: <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/escaping-characters-java' target='_blank'>Escaping characters</a>. Bookmark it and peek at it occasionally until you don't need to anymore!"</p>
<p>&#34;And I recommend a very, very useful book: '<strong>Thinking in Java</strong>'... It's usually recommended to programmers a little less green than you. But it's so good that it wouldn't hurt to check it out. Start slowly. If it's unclear, set it aside and re-read through a few levels. EVERY Java programmer should read it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Begin with the first chapter: 'Introduction to Objects'. If you understand what's in there, you'll make me so proud!&#34;</p>
