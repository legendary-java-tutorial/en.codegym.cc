<p>"Hi, Amigo! Nice to see you again. Today I have two very useful lessons for you.</p>
<p><big><strong>Working with files and directories: Files, Path</strong></big></p>
<p>Before Java 7, all file management operations were performed using the <code><strong>File</strong></code> class. But in the version seven, the language's creators decided to change how we work with files and directories, because <code>File</code> had a number of shortcomings. Instead of one class, we now have: <code><strong>Paths</strong></code>, <code><strong>Path</strong></code>, and <code><strong>Files</strong></code>. <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/219-files-path" target="_blank">In this lesson</a>, we will learn how they differ from each other and why we need each of them.</p>
<p><big><strong>Creating dynamic proxy classes in Java</strong></big></p>
<p>What are dynamic proxies and what are they for? How do you create them? Read <a href="https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/208-dynamic-proxies" target="_blank">this simple lesson</a>, and you'll easily be able to answer all these questions.</p>
