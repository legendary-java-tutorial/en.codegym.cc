You've reached Level 19!
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Congratulations, you've completed Level 8 of the quest! You've studied input/output streams, learned how to write your own wrapper for System.in, and completed 29 tasks (unless you left a few for later). On Level 9, we'll continue to get acquainted with streams as we study the Reader/Writer interfaces and FileReader/FileWriter classes.
