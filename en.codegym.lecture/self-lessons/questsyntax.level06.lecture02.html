Garbage collection
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
If you don't save references to objects, the garbage collector will come for them at night to terminate them. As scary as this may sound, programmers are ready to pray to the Java garbage collector. Especially people who started their programming careers using other languages, such as C++.

"Greetings, Amigo, my dear student. I'm glad to see you here at the library. I want to ask you something  important: what do you think of Garbage Collectors?" </p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Oh… Professor, you know… I guess it could be my cup of tea if I were to stop learning how to program…"</span></p>
<p>"Ha! Amigo, sometimes you're really funny. However, this is a serious question and I'm talking about Java."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Well, I have to admit I know nothing about the topic, sorry…"</span></p>
<p>"No worries, Amigo. That's okay for a CodeGym 6th grader. I have a useful article for you. It's called <a href='https://codegym.cc/groups/posts/15-object-lifecycle-' target='_blank'>Object lifecycle</a>. Please read it. You’ll find out how garbage collection works."</p>
