Research conducted by the secret CodeGym training center in 3101 showed that even the best students studying the most fascinating and advanced technical skills sometimes lose their motivation. That's why we've got a super specialist who has developed a special motivational program in the form of accessible lessons. Don't skip them. They're very helpful.

<p><span class="text-green">20th century staples includes things such as vacuum cleaners, washing machines, TVs, and cars.</span></p>
<p>If you were still hand-washing your laundry, riding a horse, or using candles, people in the 20th century would say you were living in the 1800s.</p>
<p><span class="text-green">The 21st century was characterized by the Internet, mobile phones, Skype and social networks.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Internet lets you access all human knowledge. </strong>You can work or run your own business online, get an online education, or teach online.</p>
<p>Through social networks, you can find friends, a job, a boyfriend/girlfriend, hobby group, etc. You can get to know almost any person in the world, and ask him or her for advice or help. You can make friends with people from all over the world, visit them, invite them over, or go on trips together.</p>
<p>You can chat on Skype with your friends, brothers, sisters, parents, relatives, or anyone in any country. <strong>Free two-way video communication from any point on the globe is something we couldn’t even have dreamed about 20 years ago.</strong> Today, it’s a part of everyday life.</p>
<p>Google Street View lets you take a virtual stroll down the streets of any city in any country. You can choose the place where you want to spend the rest of your life and then move there.</p>
<p>Modern smartphones let their owners talk to people or text them, send pictures, look up information on the web, and install hundreds of thousands of free apps. And what else? Make video calls, listen to music, watch videos, take videos or photos, find your location on a map, take notes, use calendar apps, socialize on social networks, and, of course, upvote posts with cute kitten pics.</p>

<p>Enough living in the 20th century, waiting for somebody to tell you what to learn, when to take your exams, what to do, and where to live! It's up to you. <strong>Opportunities to change your life are everywhere.</strong></p>
<p><span class="text-user">Let's finish with an old joke:</span></p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a terrible flood. Everybody was trying to escape, except for a pious old man who stayed at home and prayed.<br />
People in a truck driving by shouted to him,<br />
&#34;Jump in, save yourself!&#34;<br />
&#34;I've been praying and keeping God's commandments all my life. God will save me,&#34; said the stranded man.<br />
When the water went up to his windows, a rowboat came by. Same offer, same response.<br />
Then the water reached the roof. The man kept praying on the rooftop.<br />
A helicopter came by. Again, same offer, same answer.<br />
Finally, the man drowned and went to Heaven, where he reproached God:<br />
&#34;I've prayed and been good all my life. Why did You let me drown?&#34;<br />
&#34;I sent you a truck, a rowboat, and a helicopter. What more did you expect?&#34;</p>
