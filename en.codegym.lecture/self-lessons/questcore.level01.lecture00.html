You've reached Level 11!
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
Congratulations, this marks the beginning of the second quest! You will learn the basics of OOP, streams, and serialization. You'll learn about method overloading, interfaces and multiple inheritance. Regular practice (by completing tasks) will help you pass all 10 levels in this quest and you'll soon be ready to complete mini-projects.
