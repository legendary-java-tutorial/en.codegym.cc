Practice with abstract classes
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
In this task, we need to use multiple inheritance to model the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon! To do this, we create Dog, Cat and Mouse classes, and implement interfaces in them. The cat can move, eat, and be eaten. The mouse can move and be eaten. The dog can move and eat.
