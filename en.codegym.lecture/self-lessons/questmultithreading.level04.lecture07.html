What really happens (i.e. what the compiler generates from classes)
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
"Hi, Amigo! Here's some more information for you." "I already told you that the compiler actually converts all anonymous classes into ordinary inner classes." "Yep. I even remember that their names are numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc." "Exactly. But there's another nuance here." "If a class is declared inside a method and uses any of its variables, then references to those variables will be added to the generated class ..."

<p>"Hi, Amigo! Here's some more information for you."</p>
<p>"I already told you that the compiler actually converts all anonymous classes into ordinary inner classes."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Yep. I even remember that their names are numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc."</span></p>
<p>"Exactly. But there's another nuance here."</p>
<p>"If a class is declared inside a method and uses any of its variables, then references to those variables will be added to the generated class. See for yourself."</p>
<p>"We start with this:"</p>
<div class="code-heading">Before compiling:</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code><span class="text-green">class Car
{</span>
 <span class="text-user">public ArrayList createPoliceCars(int count)
 {
  ArrayList result = new ArrayList();

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
  {
 </span><span class="text-viola">final int <strong>number</strong></span><span class="text-user"> = i;
   result.add(new <span class="text-red">Car()
    {
     public String toString()
     {
      return ""+number;
     }
    }</span>);
  }
  return result;
 }</span>
<span class="text-green">}</span></code></pre>
<p>"And the compiler generates this:</p>
<div class="code-heading">After compiling:</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code><span class="text-green">class Car
{</span>
 <span class="text-user">public ArrayList createPoliceCars(int count)
 {
  ArrayList result = new ArrayList();

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
  {
   final int number = i;
   result.add(new Anonymous2 (number));
  }
   return result;
  }</span>

 <span class="text-red">class Anonymous2
 {
  <span class="text-yellow">final int</span> <strong>number</strong>;
  Anonymous2(int number)
 {
  <span class="text-yellow">this</span>.<strong>number</strong> = number;
 }

  public String toString()
  {
   return ""+ <strong>number</strong>;
  }
 }</span>
<span class="text-green">}</span></code></pre>
<p>"Did you get the point? The inner class can't change the method's local variable, because by the time the inner class's code is executed, we may be exiting the method altogether."</p>
<p>"Now the second point. The toString() method uses a passed variable. To accomplish this, it was necessary to:"</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong> save it inside the generated class</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong> add it to the constructor.</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Got it. Classes declared inside methods always use copies of variables."</span></p>
<p>"Exactly!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Then it makes sense why variables must be final. And why they can't be changed. If you're actually working with copies rather than the originals, the user won't understand why he can't change variables' values, which means we need to just forbid him from changing them."</span></p>
<p>"Right, declaring variables as final seems a small price to pay in exchange for having the compiler generate a class for you, pass it to the method, and save all of the method's variables that you want to use."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I agree. Anonymous local classes are still super cool."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"If I declare a local class inside a method, and I use the method's variables in it, will the compiler add them to the class too?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes, it will add them to the class and its constructor."</p>
<p>"That's what I thought."</p>
