<p>"OK, let's try another approach. I'll show you how calling methods works, and then you try to go through the previous lesson again, OK?"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Let's do it."</span></p>
<p>"Great. I'll tell you about calling functions/methods and the values they return (return values)."</p>
<p>"Commands, or statements, are grouped into methods so they can be executed as a single block, like a single complex command. To do this, you need to write the method (function) name and then list the method's arguments inside parentheses."</p>
<div class="code-heading">Example</div>
<pre class="line-numbers language-java" data-line="" data-start=""><code>package com.codegym.lesson2;
public class MethodCall
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
         <span class="text-red">print4</span>(<span class="text-green">"I like to move it, move it."</span>);
    }

    public static void <span class="text-red">print4</span>(String s)
    {
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>"In the example above, we wrote a function that will display the passed string on the screen four times. Then we called the <code><span class="text-red">print4</span></code> function in line 6."</p>
<p>"When the program reaches line 6, it will jump to line 9, assigning the value <code><span class="text-green">'I like to move it, move it'</span></code> to the variable s."</p>
<p>"Then lines 11-14 will be executed. The function will finish, and the program will resume on line 7."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I see."</span></p>
<p>"Not only can you pass arguments (values) to a function—a function can return the result of its work (return value). This is done with the keyword return. This is how it looks:"</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"I think it's starting to make sense! The code in the left and right columns is actually the same. It's just that the code on the left has a standalone function."</span></p>
<p><span class="text-user">"The function computes a certain value and uses the return statement to pass that value to whatever called it. At least, that's how I see it."</span></p>
<p>"And you're right!"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"But what is this void type?"</span></p>
<p>"Some functions just do something without computing or returning any value, like our <strong>main()</strong> method. A special return type–<strong>void</strong>–was created for such functions."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Why not just declare nothing if a function doesn't return anything?"</span></p>
<p>"Remember how we declare any variable? Type and name. For functions, we declare a type, name, and parentheses. A function name followed by parentheses is how you call the function."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"So, it was easier to invent a 'void type' than to divide functions into two categories – those that return values and those that do not?"</span></p>
<p>"Exactly! You're really smart, my boy."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"How do we return a void type?"</span></p>
<p>"We don't. It works like this. <span class="text-corporate">When executing the return statement, the Java machine computes the value of the expression to the right of the word 'return', stores this value in a special part of the memory, <strong>and immediately ends the function</strong>.</span> The stored value is used where the function was called, as the result of calling the function. You can see it in the example I gave earlier."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"You mean the part where int m = min(a, b) is transformed into m = m2?"</span></p>
<p>"Yes. After the function is finished, everything works as if the function's return value was written in its place. <span class="text-red">Repeat this phrase in your mind and look at the code in the last example.</span>"</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"I think this only seems easy. It's actually difficult. I've only understood parts of it."</span></p>
<p>"That's OK. <span class="text-green">On the first try, you can only understand things you already know.</span> The more things you don't understand, the deeper you are plunging into something new, and the better your results will be. It will become clearer with time."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Well, if you say so. Let's keep going."</span></p>
