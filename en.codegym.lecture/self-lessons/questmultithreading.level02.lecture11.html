<p>"I hope I didn't scare you too much, my friend. No?"</p>
<p>"Okay, good. So, our new topic is regular expressions."</p>
<p>"If we oversimplify them, regular expressions are patterns for strings."</p>
<p>"You can check whether <strong>a string matches a given pattern.</strong> You can also split a string into parts using a delimiter or a pattern."</p>
<p>"But let's start with something simple: <strong>what is a pattern?</strong>"</p>
<p>"In SQL (but not in Java), you can check whether a string matches a particular pattern. This is how it looks:"</p>
<pre data-line="" data-start="" class="line-numbers language-java"><code>name like 'Alex%'</code></pre>
<p>Here name is a variable, like is a command to check a pattern, and "Alex%" is the pattern.</p>
<p>In this case, % means any string or substring.</p>

<p>"Okay, then let's move on to regular expressions."</p>
<p>"Regular expressions typically include restriction not only on the number of characters, but also their 'content'. "Any mask usually consists of two (sometimes more) parts: the first describes character 'preferences', and the second describes the number of characters."</p>

<p><span class="text-user">"Still all clear."</span></p>
<p>"Really? Hmm. Either I explained everything really well or you're too quick on the uptake. Well, either way, that's good for us."</p>
<p>"Here are a couple of new insights for you."</p>
<p>"Since regular expressions are often used to find substrings, we can add two more characters (^ and $) to our patterns."</p>
<p>"^ means that the substring must include the beginning of the string."</p>
<p>"$ means that the substring must include the end of the string."</p>
<p>"Here are some examples:"</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th width="30%">Pattern</th>
        <th width="70%">String and substrings that match the pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>a{3}</td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">aaa</span> a <span class="text-green">aaa</span> a <span class="text-green">aaa</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>a{3}$</td>
        <td><strong>aaa a aaa a <span class="text-green">aaa</span></strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>^a{3}</td>
        <td><strong><span class="text-green">aaa</span> a aaa a aaa</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>^a{3}$</td>
        <td><strong>aaa a aaa a aaa</strong></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>"And one more important point."</p>
<p>"In regular expressions, the following characters have special meaning: [ ] \ / ^ $ . | ? * + ( ) { }. They're called control characters. So, you can't simply use them in strings."</p>
<p>"As in Java code, they must be escaped. "And again as in Java code, the '\' character is used for this."</p>
<p>"If we want to describe a string consisting of three '?' characters, we can't write '?{3}', because '?' is a control character. We need to do it like this: \?{3}. If we want to use a '\' character, then we need to write '\\'."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"OK, got it."</span></p>
<p>"And now here's another interesting tidbit. In files with Java code, the '\' character must also be escaped in strings, since it's a control character."</p>
<p><span class="text-user">"Of course."</span></p>
<p>"So, if you're trying to define a Java regular expression in a string, then you need to escape the '\' character twice."</p>
<p>"Here's an example:"</p>
<table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <th width="100%"></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>I want a mask that matches 'c:\anything'</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>In theory, the regular expression should look like this:<br />
            one 'c' character,<br />
            colon,<br />
            backslash,<br />
            period, and asterisk (to denote any number of characters). I added spaces to improve readability:<br />
            c : \ .*<br />
            But the characters '\' and '.' need to be escaped, so the regular expression will look like this:<br />
            c :  <span class="text-red">\\</span><span class="text-green">\.</span>*<br />
            Or, without spaces<br />
            c:<span class="text-red">\\</span><span class="text-green">\.</span>*</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>"We should have three backslashes in our regular expression.<br>
            That means that in a Java file the regular expression will look like this:"<br />
            String regexp = "c:<span class="text-red">\\\\</span><span class="text-green">\\.</span>*";</td>
